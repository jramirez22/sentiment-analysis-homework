# sentiment-analysis-homework

This project complements a set of provided files to create different models for sentiment analysis. The models are able to predict, based on a text (reviews from [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/)), whether it has a positive or negative sentiment. In turn, these models are compared and the different variations in the hyper parameters are discussed.

## Installation

It is recommended to use a virtual environment before installing the libraries used in the project. The necessary libraries are found in the requirements.txt file in pip format. To install the libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

## Discussion

### Models

The main hyperparameters that we use to create different models and be able to compare them are the following:

1. Rating threshold for reviews: This parameter tells us the threshold at which we will count a review as positive. It is important to remember that each review is evaluated between the following values (10, 20, 30, 40, 50), with 10 being terrible and 50 being excellent.
2. As a second hyperparameter we use the amount of preprocessing that exists within the reviews. This is if the model has the removal of stopwords, creation of bigrams and/or lemmatization.
3. The third hyperparameter is the min_count in bigram creation. min_count ignore all words and bigrams with total collected count lower than this value.

* #### Model 3


## Team contributions

Our team contributions are divided as follow:

- Diego Casta침eda: Responsible for creating the prediction function according to a model.
- Jose Antonio Ramirez: Responsible for the evaluation of the models, creation of metrics and documentation.
- Sebasti치n Galindo: Responsible for the creation of different models according to different hyper parameters discussed in the group.
