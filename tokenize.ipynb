In fact given its central location, just about every attraction in the town is accessible by walk. The place is a cosy nook with few rooms. That said, you can almost have their little lounge to yourself when you want. The rooms are tastefully done with Guatemalan textile and clean. The bed was comfortable as well. The only issue I had was the lack of ventilation. The room window opened to the steps just besides the room that would compromise my privacy but as I had mentioned, there are few rooms and very less people in the property so it was fine. The highlight of the place is the breakfast cooked by the\",\n 'Good location on the NW of town, especially if youre going to Antiguena spanish school. 100q for good sized private twin room with shared bathroom - great price Nice ish garden with a swing and hamock Basic bathrooms - very tatty but has hot showers always (if you keep the water flow slow) Super basic, pretty dirty kitchenette Loads of cats and dogs  Its very cheap and basic.

Our group members were completely satisfied with their stay. The service was exceptionally accommodating. Since our three nights occurred over a period of 10 days while we volunteered and visited in other cities, they allowed us to store extra luggage between our stays. The rooms are a bit tight but the beds are comfortable. Some rooms have one bed, others have two, and some have a private bath and some shared. We preferred the two bed private bath option. It s a small hotel, with possibly ten to 15 rooms maximum. The included breakfast was satisfactory with fresh fruit and toast. Also',\n 'We went to the hotel directly to book a room. The receptionist at first gave us a really high price then lowered it. When we asked how much it costs in qetales she gave us an 8.2 comission rate to dollars and I knew she was randomly goving us a non existing rate so then she \"lowered\" it to the real rate. After we agreed that the price includes breakfast the following morning we get to breakfast and received two plain pieces of toast and fruit while theother tables received also eggs and plantines. So I asked if we also get eggs abd plantines and she replied \"no\". How come we didn\\'t get the same breakfast when we paid for it?? Not a good experience at all at the hotel. There are much better places in Antigua to stay.',\n \"I'm going to break this up with the good and bad.   Good: Location Free breakfast Hot shower Warm, helpful staff One hour massage for 150Q ($20)  Bad: Small rooms without great air circulation AWFUL quality beds Very noisy dogs next door  I'll let you decide which are more important to you. To me, an awful bed kills it for me. But the $20 massages made me feel better about my choice. Not sure if I'd come back because my back can't handle it.   By the way, the $50/night advertised on here is totally wrong. It ended up being $90/night for a triple room. Not really worth it to me since there are so many other choices.   \",\n \"I arrived late at night after a delayed bus journey and my original accommodation had been given away. This was the only place I could find which could accommodate me, so for that I was grateful.

There was no key for the door apparently, however it did lock from the inside, although it did not feel a very secure place to stay other than having a night guard and big front door which is locked throughout the night.

It is located very conveniently close to the famous yellow Arch in Antigua and just down one block from the town square, shopping, banking and restaurants. You can't tell from the outside, but this small hotel has a beautiful courtyard with blooming plants, greenery and a pool. There is also a covered breakfast area that became our gathering place in the morning mostly because they had free coffee and cold water. Fortunately, our room was upstairs above the breakfast area. Even though there are stairs to haul your suitcases up and down, try to reserve room 10, 11 or 12. Those rooms have a balcony that you can watch Volcano Fuego erupt every night! There are several benches to sit on along the room\",\n 'Eight of us were staying in a home stay in Antigua, the last weekend we wanted four rooms in a nice hotel. Being we were already here we wanted to see the hotels and maybe even look at a room.  I was meeting my friend here to take a look. I arrived early. The front desk clerk was having a personal call and refused to acknowledge me or even look up at me.  I was ten minutes early so I took a look at the lobby and the pool. I used the men’s room.  The front desk went wild. She started screaming at me that men’s room was only for guests. She was screaming at me and it was embarrassing. She basically kicked me out!  Needless to say we did NOT book this hotel for our group! ',\n 'We booked this hotel because of its great location, pool and parking. It had good reviews in Lonely Planet.  I had requested an upstairs room, with a balcony, and that is what we got, with a view of the volcano. The room was very clean.  However, it is way overpriced for what you get- tiny, although quaint and rather charming rooms. The big drawback was the noise. It is next door to a venue with five bars in it, and very loud music reverberates through the walls from Thursday - Saturday night, until 1am. There was no way we were going to be able to sleep through that! To their credit, the management rang the bar and asked them to turn it down, which they did, but it was still terribly loud. The manager then came up and offered us a room at another hotel, which we were happy to',\n \"It's a very nice Resort with Great Food and Beautiful Scenery in the Mountains close to the City of Guatemala and not too far from the Many Volcano' there.

I arrived to the hotel around 10 am and already read previous reviews of how they want to charge for early check in but didn't expect it to be that bad!!! First, I was told no rooms are available and I have to wait a couple hours, than after 10 minutes of waiting the receptionist called me and said they have a room available but they are charging $10 per hour of early check in.standard checking time is 3pm so he asked for additional of $50 in order to check me in at 10 am. I was very disappointed and upset to be treated this way specially after I explained him that I already paid for two nights almost $300 and that I had a red eye fly and just wanted to rest. somehow we negotiated to $30 but still feels like a rip off. Disgusting!  2. I decided to stay additional night and\",\n 'Hotel was good with a good restaurant and breakfast. Two pools to be enjoyed, spa and gym and also tennis courts.

I've been here with family, friends, and strangers about to become friends.  This is not a five-star property.  Its conversion from hacienda to hotel was slap-dash and haphazard. There can, at times, be too much street noise, and the wifi is wonky. ...but I'll be back, and I'll recommend it to friends as an oasis from their expectations.  The courtyards and walk ways will hang with dense flowering vines in the spring and summer, that when added to the flowering shrubs and trees perfumes this small world in a way Chanel aspires to.  The fountain in the main courtyard adds its own bouquet and the soundtrack of splashing water.  It's a perfect place to sip a beer, read a book, fall\",\n 'I stayed at the Hotel Casa from February 27 - 28 and March 3-4th. Upon arrival I noticed the magnificent garden and all it’s beautiful flowers.  The staff was very welcoming.  They do a lot of business with my company often so they already knew to have certain accommodations in place. The location is perfect. Two blocks close to the Arch, a few blocks close to Central Park and best a bunch of restaurants. Breakfast was delicious. Overall, I had a good stay. One suggestion.... Leave a night light at the entrance. My flight was at 6am so I had to leave at 4am. I was in room #18. I had to use the flashlight on my phone to find my way to the front.',\n 'I recently stayed at the Villa Colonial Hotel during a work conference. This colonial style hotel is very well taken care of. The rooms are nice and clean, the bathrooms are comfortable and the ambiance overall is great. The food is good although the restaurant could benefit from offering more choices. My stay overall was very enjoyable.',\n \"The hotel is medium size and they made a big effort to give you the feel of a Colonial town, it just doesn't feel very authentic. It's at a walkable distance from the central park (about 9 blocks). Food is good, coffee is great, most of the staff is friendly, however the front desk people were a bit cold and will not make eye contact. The bathroom design is not very smart, there is a step after you open the door and the light switch is beyond the step, so you can easily trip on it in the dark. The shower has a partial wall and that's it, so water gets all over the floor making it very slippery. The pool is pretty and a good size, with warmish water. The little Plaza area is gorgeous and the garden is very well taken care of.\",\n \"What a nice place for a stay!  Great restaurant, good food.  Beautiful views of a volcano from a very comfortable balcony off the restaurant.  Wonderful service and really good staff herding a bunch of people around. The gardens are beautiful and extensive.  Lots of seating areas in with the flowers.  The colors are so bright through out you almost need sunglasses.  If I have one complaint it's the same complaint I have when I travel and use hotels.

It is probably a 3 to 3.5 star small \"hotel\", rustic, with a great location in the middle of town, close to all must see sites. Breakfast was very limited (scrambled egss, beans and one type of white cheese). But good value ',\n 'Great hotel with a beautiful flowered courtyard for breakfast or relaxing.  A short walk from the Central Plaza and most attractions. The neighborhood was quiet. Extremely helpful staff.  While most of the staff spoke little English the manager who was present each day was fluent.  The manager gave us information on tours and shops.  Breakfast was relatively simple but good.  Our room was not very large but was well outfitted and the bed was comfortable.  We had no issues with hot water (there was plenty).Ask for a second floor room, they have  view of Fuego ( an active volcano).   There were no negatives during our 4 night stay.  The hotel is a bargain.  We would stay there again. Stop for diner and music at the Santa Clara Cafe only a block away.',\n 'We were very happy with the Casa Noble. In fact we booked it for our return to Antigua. The staff were excellent, the breakfasts were very good as well as the location. The hotel is maybe 6 blocks from the Central Park. The room was very large, clean and had a good bathroom with lots of hot water. The hotel is in a old colonial building with a very nice garden. The rooms and lounge are decorated with antique style furniture. ',\n \"The good things: the hotel is stunning. There is a gorgeous courtyard with a manicured lawn overhung with trees and flowers. It's perfect for breakfast. My room was also gorgeous- every detail was beautiful. Even the doors were carved with a floral design. The staff is very helpful.  The less good things: I got about 90 seconds of hot water for 2 out of 3 showers. There was neither a/c nor a fan.  Merely irritating things: the front door is locked, so every time you come back to the hotel, you have to knock and hope someone heard you. Also, it's a little ways from the central part of town, but it's a small town, so that's only about 10-15 minutes of walking.\",\n 'We were in the room in front of the entrance, which has a very squeaky gate (a drop of oil would sort the problem in two seconds) so we could hear everyone who came in or went out; also people tended to stop in front of the room to talk and they could look inside through the windows. If you closed the shutters however, the room was very dark. Maybe the rooms upstairs are better. The bed sheets were old and looked worn and they did not fit the double mattresses. Also the pillows were pretty horrendous. The towels were a bit threadbare. On the plus side, the shower was good with very hot water and the room was clean.  It could be a decent place but it needs looking after. It is certainly overpriced.',\n \"This place is a dump.  there is no hot water here during the day.  In the evenings yes, but not during the day.  the shower was disgusting.  don't waste your money here.  For less money you can stay at a hotstel and have hot water.\",\n \"This hotel was terrible in every measureable way. Throughout our entire stay we were the only people in this hotel. We ordered a private room but the door didnt lock properly so we had to take nearly everything with us when we went out. The shower was extremely cold and did'nt lock either- this was a big issue as we were travelling with a girl and someone had to sit outside while she was showering  Overall, i would recommend to stay as far away as you can from this hotel, it will ruin your visit to this beautiful town\",\n 'Ended up here after a long search through Antigua for an affordable hotel. For some reason prices were extremely high at other places because of the weekend.. We were welcomed by a friendly young woman who showed us the room. Had a private room with a nice bed on the first floor at the front of the building. The shower was actually one of the best we have had, good amount of water and warm (hot!). We also had breakfast which was Tipico Guatemala and really nice. So if you are looking for an adorable place with a nice spacious room, go for it! On the map it looks way out of the city centre but actually it is only a 5-10min walk.',\n 'Very friendly staff! Room amenities were ok, but nothing special! Very close to town centre! We were unlucky that one of the apartments (no.6) next to us was owned by an American who really liked the sound of his own voice and liked to drink a lot!

Location was good on a fairly busy but not too loud street. Basic amenities.  No AC and hot water was not working. Clean and safe place. Nice little courtyard. No hairdryer. Overall a decent place if you’re not too picky. ',\n \"As a former resident of Antigua there are lots of hotels like this one.  Like others have said in the reviews, the rooms are super clean, the bathrooms are nice, they have flat screen tv's in every room and it truly is a cute little hotel.  What is exceptional is how nice, kind, and super friendly the owner and his son are.  Thats what makes this review a little difficult for me.  I so want to love this hotel and support this hotel and the owners but there are 2 things that you will likely struggle with if you stay here.  1. Its kinda noisey.  Yes, they have parking inside....literally inside.  We were in bed and asleep at 10:00 pm and awaken to the sound of a car backing into the downstairs court yard and they noise was loud enough to sound like we were sleeping in the garage. \",\n 'very nice stay, nice corner garden room, with confortable beds. bathroom a little small but confortable, need more space in the bassin may be  Delicious breakfast at the hotel as well as the bar ,i had some sándwiches to remember... very nice attention, i would really recommend your stay in Porta Antigua',\n \"Great setting, very relaxing and good location about 5-10 min walk from the main square. Lots of really positive stuff about the resort - gym is good, pool area is great for kids as is the playground. Deluxe garden room was recently renovated and very smart. Dinner at the restaurant was very good. Most of the staff were also lovely and very friendly and helpful. Relaxed vibe.  The negative stuff - mainly hinged around our reception experiences to be honest. We arrived at 830pm, one guy on reception and a large wedding party taking place so probably a bit stressed. However, he wasn't very welcoming, was quite dismissive and just wanted to get me to sign various paperwork, give us the key and send us on our way.

There is a place to park nearby 50Q for overnight so not the cheapest place but often worth it.',\n 'Great place to stay overall. The room was spacious and clean. The staff was also very friendly and helpful. It has a nice patio and balcony where you can relax. And if you walk a minute you are right in the hart of Antigua. I would 100% recommend this place.',\n 'The staff at Hotel Posada Santa Teresita is  friendly and helpful. The owner is lovable. The room was simple but nice. Location very good, but a bit away from Plaza Mayor. Good value for money. Generally, I  recommend this place.',\n 'The hotel is very clean, seems new, and is in good working order. The customer service is impecable and breakfast was very good.  As far as the negatives, parking was a nightmare, since they do not have own parking and we were sent to a sketchy place. The parking attendant seemed confused as to which hotel we were coming from, and he did not tell us that other cars would be blocking our exit. It ended up working out well. Also, bathrooms are very small, as there is no place to put down your toiletries bag. Finally, the street the hotel is on does have heavy traffic at times (I was there on a weekend).',\n \"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Hotel is lovely, rooms are comfortable with modern bathrooms. It's slightly further away from the centre of town, so while this is ok during the day, it may make some people feel slightly unsafe walking there late at night, as the streets are not well lit. We had no problems though. Breakfast here was fantastic - freshly made to order and huge servings. The only thing we would say is that the service isn't fantastic. Since it is a small hotel, quite a lot of the time there is only one staff member available, and sometimes this person did not speak English. We had a few times where we had some questions and couldn't really get assistance from the hotel. But we still enjoyed our stay here, as this didn't bother us too much.\",\n \"The room has a view on the main street of Antigua. The location is very central and there is a very small balcony that allowed us to see the busy street from the second floor. The rooms have Wi-fi, TV and a safe. There's no problem with hot water in the shower.  The breakfast is served every morning on a roof terrasse that is beautifully decorated and where you can also hang out throughout the day to read or browse internet. The woman serving breakfast is super nice and the breakfast are delicious: there is a choice of main meal and there is a food display of: coffee or tea, fresh water, bread, cereals, fresh fruits and cheese. Fresh orange juice was also part of the breakfast.  Only negatives: I think you pay more just because the location is on the main street. Also there is\",\n 'Nice hotel in central location.  As a word of warning despite what is advertised on their website, trip advisor and booking.com this venue does NOT have a 24 hour reception.

To their credit the hotel management team did go the extra mile to help try and recover the bag the next day.',\n 'We stayed for 3 nights. Room was clean and we had enough space.

We asked her to cancel our reservation and to not charge our card and she said she would cancel it. We stayed the night at another hotel, but our card still got charged.

The location is excellent, two blocks away from the Central Park and the rooftop view is beautiful. Breakfast was provided each morning which was good. Being from Canada, it was a little bit pricey because of the exchange but they have no control over that. Don’t forget to include the 22% tax on the posted rate which we forgot about. However, our room had no curtain in the bathroom so we were unable to leave the window open while we were showering which resulted in the room being very humid and steamy. Additionally the roll up blind in the bedroom was broken which reduced the amount of fresh air coming into the room. These are easy fixes which hopefully they will take care of upon reading this review. Would I stay here',\n 'Stayed here for 3 nights. I am aware of very high ratings of this hotel. I agree with some points mentioned, it was very clean, very good service as they booked my transportation very fast and efficient. However room #9 was very small, no where to put my stuff, no closet. Fast internet. But very small TV with no english channels. No refrigerator in the room, and no safe, so I had to visit the city taking the passport and money with me. Privacy was also in question.

As soon as we mentioned our hotel name to the driver, the  couple in front told us that they had booked that hotel 3 days prior using booking.com and this was not honored. We thought that this was just one bad incident. Wrong!  The manager just refused to look at the booking.com printout and told us no room.

Breakfast was ok, and parking is not on site but 2.5 blocks away wasn't so inconvenient. You can walk to the central square in 10-15 min. It was shaping up to be a nice deal for Antigua at $105 per night.

Unfortunately, the second night, there was a loud bar playing music\",\n 'We had a large room for a family of four. The room is nicely decorated, though the bathroom is kind of small.

The hotel is very well located right in the middle of Antigua, and the personnel is friendly and helpful.',\n \"We chose Casa Noble because it was safe and 'kid-friendly'. The staff was attentive and friendly. Our 18 month old enjoyed playing in the garden. We appreciated breakfast included in the daily price and the hotel was in walking distance to the central park. For the price compared to other places, we were satisfied with our stay. However, we had to close our windows because of the mosquitos and our room got pretty stuffy. Maybe they could have a few portable fans available. I have also stayed in places that have better showers. It was a sufficient short-term place to stay. They had Wifi and it was a colonial style hotel.\",\n 'There are many wonderful places to stay in Antigua and I have stayed in quiet a few of them...but one of my favorites is Casa Noble. I have visited twice. It is not exactly centrally located but still close to down town...this is actually a good thing because In general Latin America is very noisy at night...and this hotel is relatively quiet...the rooms are comfortable...cosy even with period furnishing...that fit the feel of a historic building and town. The hotel offers free Wi Fi, warm showers and a full breakfast. Definitely get the typical Guatemalan breakfast...It is served in the garden eating area which is both peaceful and beautiful. The hotel is priced at about $75 US a night...this is actually a mid range hotel but is a good bargin for the pice. Parking is not',\n 'This little hotel in antigua is perct for a weekend or a trip. You can choose for room in the 2nd floor with great views of the volcano and city. The breakfast is good, you choose from 2 options, continental or guatemalan. Not abundant but perfect. In the courtyard you are surrounded by the garden, so peaceful.   Overall the room is clean, good bathroom, hot water. Some rooms have fireplace that works! Price is good for value.  The service is great!',\n 'I hate to write this because when you arrive the hotel is truly beautiful. The staff is lovely and food is great. I stayed with a friend traveling to Antigua we were very happy on arrival. The next day we woke up to being covered in bed bugs. Which is not a way to spend your vacation. It was horrible. The hotel asked for proof which we had provided. They did launder our clothes and change our rooms which was appreciated. What was worse was they rented out our room the next night and whoever took over quickly checked out. Antigua is a wonderful city but I would stay somewhere else.',\n 'At first we weren\\'t sure about this little hotel as they are in a state of upgrading & it\\'s a bit old... but pretty much everything is in Antigua!  So we gave it a chance... everything was sufficient enough & quite clean. But what makes the place is the owners & staff!  Jose is over the top welcoming & will do anything to help you.  Matteo was always at the door or in the courtyard to keep watch & help at any time, day or night, it seemed!  Then there was the breakfast! Holy smokes.  They did two beautiful sit down meals for us that were delicious & filling... omelets, plantains, beans, fruit, bread, butter/jam, coffee, juice, oatmeal....hot & ready at the exact time we requested it.  This hotel is also very close to La Merced Church, the famous Arch & \"California Tacos\" which I',\n 'We had a group of 10 and we were accommodated very nicely.  Nice clean and comfortable beds.  Staff was very nice and helpful!  This was our first time staying at this hotel.  We would definitely stay here again.  Atmosphere was nice and quiet :)',\n \"We've stayed at Hotel Casa Maria Jose many times since we discovered it in 2007, have had many accompanying friends stay there too. We've always been pleased with the warm reception, the cleanliness, the convenience to the sites in Antigua, and the Spanish colonial style.\",\n \"We found this hotel after driving around in bewildered circles around Antigua looking for a place to stay on New Year's Day. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and large. The owners even allowed us to park our motorcycles in the courtyard, where they would be secure and we could see them from our room.\",\n 'We discovered Casa Maria Jose when another reservation fell through. It was our gain! The rooms are generous-sized, the bathrooms are roomy, and there is parking, if you need it. The owners are lovely people. The hotel is within walking distance of La Merced and restaurants and internet service are close by.',\n \"We were very disappointment by this hotel.  It started with the fact that they didn't have our reservation and they wanted to send us to another hotel. I complaied abiout it and mentioned that just one day before I exchanged e-mails with the owned to re-confirm the transfer from the airport to the hotel (took from them) so they knew I was coming. How can they say they don't have my reservation? In the end they gave us a room just to discover a dirty, noisy place having nothing in commune with the photo's on the web site. At the end of our trip we used another hotel in Antigua for half the price of this one and much cleaner, comfortable and nicer.  Also none of the people at the reception spoke English. And they were not trained at all. They have no idea how to accept our payment\",\n 'This is a lovely, comfortable guesthouse run by friendly staff, very well situated and close to most attractions. Breakfast is served on a pleasant terrace and rooms are comfortable, quiet and clean. I arrived close to 2am (around 3 hours late) due to my flight being delayed but the friendly, smiling owner/manager was there to greet me and show me to my room. There is also a nice cafe on site. I would recommend this guesthouse. ',\n 'I love staying at Hotel Casa del Parque, the rooms are beautiful, the staff is lovely, great location and the pool and sauna are fab!!   Points to note, if you are a light sleeper, make sure you ask to not have the room that is by the street, as it is in a central location there is a lot of foot traffic and although Antigua mostly winds down around 10pm on the weekend it can get loud!',\n \"This was our first visit to Guatemala and we were very pleased with our experience at Casa del Parque.  The architecture and decor were beautiful, as was the flower and greenery- filled courtyard and pool area.  Our room was clean, nicely decorated, and very comfortable.  We were travelling without children so didn't mind the proximity of our room to a nearby very busy nightclub; I would suggest contacting the hotel prior to making a reservation to assure that if you seek quiet on the weekends that you are in a different area of the hotel.  On the flip side, we appreciated the proximity of this hotel to the vast offerings of restaurants, clubs and pubs.  And it is only a few doors down from the beautiful central Park.  Felt safe walking throughout the city and enjoyed the\",\n 'Having stayed in Antigua previously, we then decided to book an ‘upmarket’ hotel for our final night pre-flight. This hotel was in a decent location, but it was dirty and not comfortable compared to the cheaper hotel we had previously stayed in. When we arrived we had to ask to have the sheets changed due to being dirty, and throughout our stay we also noticed that the mugs had old lipstick on, and towels were dirty, and so were the pillowcases. It was the first time I considered using my sleeping bag inner to sleep in the bed during my entire stay in Guatemala. The staff offered no solution to the problems. Antigua is walkable where you stay, so the location is not at all relevant. Definitely stay elsewhere to get much better value for money and stay clean',\n \"I was GRANDPAcking in Antigua for 3 nights. On my previous visit I stayed in 2 other hotels. This time, I tried the Santa Teresita. I pre-booked a Single Room online at a 68% discount. This brought the price down from US$33 / night to US$10.50 (or GTQ121 including the additional 22% taxes). This came with a free breakfast. The room was small but came with an ensuite with daily housekeeping, a hot shower and cable TV. A Breakfast is worth about GTQ25 ... so the room was excellent value at GTQ121 but IT IS NOT worth the Rack Rate of GTQ380 / night that it is listed for. It is worth about GTQ175 / night including Breakfast. The hosts were nice people and it had a comfy common area. It is, probably, a little too much 'on the edge of town centre' for some people ... it was a decent\",\n \"My booking included breakfast but one of the young male staff member attempted to charge me.  He told me only two breakfasts were included and the others with eggs were not included.  I agreed to pay for the non included breakfast because I wanted the eggs.  When we were checking out, I told the woman I need to pay for breakfast and she corrected me saying the breakfast for me was included.  This is how I caught the previous man in a lie.  Otherwise I liked the hotel.  I paid top dollar since it was peak time.  They do not accept visa, only cash.  Well I'm not sure I believe that now since that man lied about the breakfast.\",\n \"It's a basic hotel, the staff were nice and friendly. The location is ok, slightly on the fringe of the centre and at night, the street lights are not so bright in the area. If you happen to get the bedroom at the back of the hotel, there is an open-air market that starts really early and can be noisy for those light sleepers. Otherwise, it's ok if you're looking for a cheap and clean place to stay in Antigua.\",\n \"I stayed here for two nights and thought it was a good budget hotel.  There is a kitchen you can use and the rooms are very clean.  The owners and staff were always available and very helpful.  It's on a busy road, but the rooms are tucked away in back so noise was not a problem.  It is not fancy, but I think it's perfect for the budget traveler:  quiet, clean, decent location at a great price with friendly owners.\",\n 'We booked one night in Antigua so wanted it to be special. Visiting during Holy Week we wanted to be sure to see the procession over the flower petal murals. Casa Buena Vista was perfect as the procession went right past the front of the hotel!  The location is perfect for exploring the city as well. It’s a great place from which to launch a walking circuit of all the sites in the city and is very close to a square where a (cooked) food market bustles at night. Plenty of tiendas for essentials like wine and snacks too.   As for the property, it is just lovely. Pass through a locked gate to a gorgeous small colonial courtyard with a small fountain. There is also a rooftop where we sipped wine before dinner.   We were in room 3 and my suggestion would be to avoid rooms 1 thru 3.',\n 'I made a Booking.com reservation. And they ask to paid in the hotel the night. Then they charge me the night in my credit card. weeks and weeks asking the refund, and only a waste of time. Very polite in the whatsapp, but at the end they took my money twice, never got the refund. Just thieves. AVOID AT ALL COST, WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.',\n 'The Hotel is well located. Rooms are very nice, clean and the bed was really comfy. Rooms had Cable and Fans. The bathroom was pretty cool, tiles are like rocks, feels your are in a waterfall, although is missing a bit of an air outlet.  It has a parking lot just behind it (with a private entrance to the hotel), for 50Q will keep your car the whole day.- Remember to book your space in advance.  It has a nice location (not to near to the Santa Catalina Gate but perfect to walk). Staff was extra friendly and ready to help.   It has a nice patio that was lit up at night. Very dreamy.   I would stay here again.',\n \"We stayed here for five nights whilst we were in Guatemala.  It seems that many stay in the South West of Antigua where McDonald's and Subway were located, but I am glad that we stayed in the opposite side of the city, where it was quiet. We walked all over the town - even the main market was about 15 - 17 minutes on foot.  We had to go to the bank in the Central Park a couple of times, but it was within ten minutes.  Breakfast (included) consists of 2 eggs, black beans, fried plantains, and 2 roles (and coffee or juice).  We had to leave early twice, so we had breakfast 3 times at its lovely dining area.  Very satisfying.  When people have dinner in the courtyard, the noise comes right into your room, but normally they leave by 9 PM.  2 bottles of water replenished daily. \",\n 'We had no idea when walking through the thick wooden doors off the cobbled street that we would be entering a beautiful courtyard, a lovely garden in the middle with small table and chairs around the outside. Our room was overlooking the courtyard and was a very large comfortable room, very unusual. There is no bar or restaurant but they serve a lovely breakfast. It is in the heart of Antigua and so very easy to walk around',\n 'The rooms are OK but the majority has a shared bathroom which is shared with many and super small with the toilet in there too. Be careful with the prices they quote online as they will add 22% tourist tax!! It does represent itself as a budget hotel but in my experience the quality is definitely not higher than a hostel.',\n 'My wife and I spent 3 weeks at this apartment hotel and were totally satisfied with our accommodation..  It was very clean and bright and one of the best equipped places we have ever stayed at.  This was a very important feature for us because my wife likes to cook a lot when we are away and normally the lack of good kitchen utensils limits what she can do but this was not the case here.  The location is great being within easy walking distance of the Parque Cenral and the great restaurants in the centre of Antigua.  Lesley and her staff were superb and responded very graciously to every request we made.  We will certainly stay here again on our next trip to beautiful Antigua',\n 'Once we arrived we were greeted at the closed gate by the 24 hour security guard. We were pleasingly surprised when we walked into the condo. We had a small living room, dining room, full kitchen with cooking utensils, washer & dryer and private open air outside sitting area downstairs. Upstairs was the bathroom and bedroom with ample room. Our walk into town discovered a very small grocery store 1 block away for basic needs but a larger grocery store on the other side of the main town courtyard about 6 blocks away. Everything you need to do such as shopping and restaurants is within walking distance and a car is not needed while at this location.  We did use the car to go sight seeing, off the complex, to the Filadelfia Coffee Plantation.   The only negative feature was the',\n \"The Hotel itself wasn't too bad. It was a cute style with rooms that were decent and clean linen and towels. There was Wifi. The water was lukewarm. The view from the terrace was gorgeous. The location was pretty good but it is more of a quiet place to stay. The biggest issue we had was that they put us in one room for a night because other room were occupied but then they needed to move us the next night because the room we were in was the only one able to fit more beds for a larger group. This was a huge inconvenience and had they planned better it could have been avoided... otherwise pretty cute place!\",\n \"Situated a 10 min walk from the main square.  In a quiet street but with shops and bars not far away (and an amazing bakery). Our room was in a row just after reception, and had a comfortable bed with clean linens. Clean towels and toiletries provided. Shower was powerful but at best only warm. Free drinking water provided. The roof terrace view was amazing, overlooking the town and volcanoes. The owner and his family were very nice, and also helpful with information. It's a bit annoying that you aren't supplied with a front door key. Overall very good value. \",\n 'Cosy little place down on 2da avenida sur. The staff were so nice and friendly and always offering us tea and coffee! The Wi-Fi was good and it was very safe. You had to be let in by the night guard each night. Good value for money in Antigua. Not a place to stay if looking to meet others, more a quiet place to rest the head.',\n 'This small hotel is well executed, the staff is super helpful and the breakfast on the roof terrace was pleasant. That said, like many hotels in Antigua, you don’t want to open your window to the street (most rooms) as the noise continues well into the night.  Antigua has become one big hotel; I doubt that anyone actually lives there anymore. There are a few hotels on the periphery that have the space to block out the street noise, but unfortunately, this isn;t one of them. Maybe it’s all those old school buses we send down to Guatemala…',\n 'Comfortable stay at Posada Don Valentino.  Our second stay at this hotel, and we will continue to return.  The rooms are a good size, beds are comfy, and the rooms and bathrooms are always clean.  Great location in Antigua, easy to get to any part of the city.',\n 'First the good, common space nice enough. Staff friendly. Beds just ok.   Not great, noise, shower, cleanliness. They could spend very little and add fresh paint , bed sheets, curtains.., they need to clean up the place. Old run down. ',\n 'The room was nothing special and not inviting for relaxing. If you want a room to sleep and nothing more, it’s fine. The shared spaces were very nice, with a roof top balcony where we watched the fireworks at New Year which was amazing. The staff were very helpful and kind, although there was a mix up with our online payment that resulted in us taking out quetzales that we later didn’t need. We had a room with a double bed that was pushed against two walls and so was quite cramped, even for a couple. Our window was out onto what appeared to be a storage area for cleaning supplies, which meant we got to hear a lot of morning conversations from the housekeeping staff.  The hallways were pretty loud too. It seemed most rooms had no exterior windows at all so I’m glad we had our one',\n 'This hotel is operated by a group of women very close to the central plaza in Antigua. It is very clean and well staffed. The staff will make transportation shuttle arrangements to other parts of Guatemala. They were able to assist us with everything.',\n 'El hotel is advertised as HOTEL EURO MAYA SUITES, but the real name is HOTEL EURO MAYA. I select this hotel due to the nice reviews I was reading on TripAdvisor, my question is those reviews are real? Or people’s opinion on service are kind of crazy lol. Or my standards are too high. The hotel website and pictures are well done Photoshop because the REAL hotel are totally different form reality. I paid ($131.85 US Dollars for 2 night like $922.95 Quetzals) with breakfast included. Room are terrible poor clean and nasty towels really old and almost useless.  The location is far from the central square, so not convenience location as the reviews said. Love Antigua Guatemala, great UNESCO cultural site and many things to learn from the Colonial time in Central America.',\n 'With the price of Hotel Euro Maya being exceedingly inexpensive, one shouldn’t expect a 5-star hotel.  The hotel had good and bad points.  * Location: The hotel’s location is ideal--less than one block from Central Park, which the whole town revolves around.   * Staff: Extremely polite, helpful, accommodating, and friendly.  * Architecture: The hotel’s interior space is gorgeous, with a Spanish Colonial style, open-air courtyard and hallways.   * Rooms: The rooms are a little dreary; definitely less spectacular than the public areas.  They could use some fresh paint and less shabby furnishings.  The worst thing about the rooms are the truly awful travel posters dotting the walls.  The posters are cheap and in shoddy frames.  The place would instantly look so much better without',\n 'Euro Maya is a nice, small hotel, with a great location! The staff are friendly and helpful. The room was clean, and the breakfast was fine. Euro Maya has two things going for it: 1. The roof-top terrace. A great spot for breakfast and enjoying the volcano views! 2. It is 3/4 a block from the Central Park. If you are looking for a posh place that has top-of-the line sheets, towels and other services, this is not it. If you are looking for a clean, friendly, affordable place to lay your head, Euro Maya fits the bill! ',\n 'We booked with this hotel when we returned to Antigua mainly because it is mistakenly listed in Booking as a 4* hotel. Well here are some facts. THIS IS NOT A 4* HOTEL, its a travel agency that happens to rent some rooms. You could tell from property sign too. The location is superb but that\\'s all. The problem with the disgraceful service began before we even step our foot it the \"hotel\", as they charged my credit card (issued by european bank = got lousy exchange rate) without asking me while I wasnt there !!!!! We arrived before the supposed check in time and when I complained, they talked about some non-existent policy for which Booking.com was mentioning nothing.   The Front Desk employees (or whatever this supposed to be, probably the travel agency) could hardly speak',\n 'We enjoyed our stay at El Hotel Meson de Maria.   Everyone was incredibly professional and courteous,   Breakfast was delicious and a perfect way to start your day  The location was incredible, we walked everywhere.  El Meson de Maria is  at the center of everything!.    This hotel is very clean and  incredibly charming, and decorated just right for Antigua!   The only thing we would of liked was for our room to be a bit bigger, and the bathroom updated.      Having said that, we highly recommend for anyone to stay at this hotel.',\n \"We were in Antigua for a birthday celebration, we booked this hotel because we thought it was centrally located and the price was ok. The hotel is located in town not very central but accessible. They offer parking but it's 4 blocks away. The bad thing about this hotel is that it's located next to the Alliance française, the weekend that we stayed there they had a concert. We were ok until the bad concert lasted until 1 am. At 1 am I had to ask the watchman to call the police, be aware that at 6:00 pm the manager leaves, they close the door and there is nobody to assist you. Also across the street there is an establishment that I am not sure if it is a bar, restaurant or hotel. They had groups of noisy people coming and going all night long. We didn't sleep, it was horrible.\",\n 'We had casa noble booked as a second option as we needed to extend our stay by one night and our accommodation told us they were full. We saw the reviews on here so went to check the place out. We were pleasantly surprised to see a very pretty hotel set around a lovely garden. We had a look at a couple of rooms and they looked clean and comfortable. The owner was also very friendly and helpful. In the end our hotel had availability and pure lazyness stopped us from moving hotels for one night. I would, however without hesitation stay at this hotel if we were to come back to antigua.',\n 'Stayed one night as our first hotel was full on the last night of the stay. Place is in a sorry state of disrepair and looked very unloved. Rooms and general appearance are a bit shabby and we were the only ones in the hotel despite the entire town being full for a big event. Service was not obvious and the place seemed spooky, Luckily just for one night but in good conscience cannot recommend.',\n 'We stumbled onto Hotel Casa Antigua at the last minute, as we were changing our travel plans. It is made from two adjoining, renovated colonial houses with high ceilings, antique touches (including a pulley to open/shut a skylight in room #5), and beautiful gardens/courtyards. The beds were comfortable, and--importantly for our family--there were multiple rooms with options for 3-4 beds. It is two blocks away from the central square and minutes from many great shops and restaurants. Although in general the hotel feels quite secluded from city noise, there were some modest issues due to the configuration of rooms opening to the courtyard. At late afternoon (and briefly in the AM), there is a huge flock of birds roosting and causing a ruckus in some of the trees in the courtyard.',\n \"This is a centrally located hotel for people wanting a decent place to stay at a fair price in Antigua. We had two rooms and they were very different in size so worth asking for a spacious room when booking. The smaller room also smelt  very strongly of cleaning fluid but it did have a window and fan. The staff were warm and friendly. There was free water and tea/coffee on tap which we hadn't found in the more expensive hotels. My private bugbear is hotels charging you for bottled drinking water in small bottles so fair play to Casa Antigua which does not do this. There are lovely places to sit quietly and a shop selling local goods.\",\n 'I would concur with all the positives about this hotel, i.e., cleanliness, convenience of location, breakfast, etc. We did not meet the owner, but rather dealt with a young lady who was new to the area, so the fact that she spoke English, did not help us much in answering local questions. The other receptionist did not speak English. She was on duty when we checked out so I was unable to resolve the $100 overcharge on our bill until I returned home. It was eventually resolved with a series of emails. If it weren’t for this uniquely negative experience, I would return to this hotel and recommend it to others. However, with so many hotels, we decided to choose another when we returned at the end of our vacation. It was not nearly as nice and more expensive.',\n 'I stayed 4 nights at this cute little hotel. It’s located at an amazing spot in the very centre, a minute walk from the park. I stayed in room 15 which has a king size bed and a private balcony with a view on the street and a volcano. The property is well maintained, has a nice pool and inner garden. Good value for money! Next door is El Barrio a traditional complex with 5 different bars. Mind that if you stay in room 15 that you will hear some faint music till around midnight. After that it’s quiet. In the other rooms I guess you are fine. We didn’t mind it, at all, it even gave some charm, guess we are city people :)',\n 'The hotel and the rooms are nice. My wife and I got the Mountain View room and the only thing we didn’t like was the bathroom. It was really small and when flushing toilet the water pressure was super super slow.  Bathroom where toilet is was really small. Need to leave door open while using it.   Really important: if you like to party. There is a super cool bar next door that lots of people visit and socialize.  If you like to sleep early to get energize for your tours, this is not the best place to stay.   Noise ends up around 1:00am   Costumer service was really amazing.  We really enjoy their service from everyone.  ',\n 'This is a lovely hotel right off the main square. Has a pool, which is great. Right next door to a few bars so its nice to have that near if that interests you, but if you have issues with noise, request an interior room. Very nice staff.',\n 'Antigua already has a lot of personality, and this hotel continues that. Helpful staff, rooms with character, great views including volcanos, They were very helpful when my initial room was a challenge as I have a light disability. It was exchanged without fuss. The food was excellent including provision for allergies.',\n 'This hotel has great service, beautiful grounds, clean rooms and comfy beds. Loved the amenities and the location. I loved having filtered water in the room.   The hotel restaurant is lacking in vegetarian options on their menu... surprising given the focus on sustainability. One night I had an asian dish for dinner.',\n 'I stayed with my wife for two nights and it was very quite and comfortable. The price is good and cheap. The owner are very nice and welcoming. The place is clean and they have also a good kitchen. Free wi fi  The bilding is a bit old and not all the rooms are the same but ours was very nice',\n 'We stayed 3 nights. We appreciated the warm welcome of the staff and room was clean and perfectly matching with the description of the website.  Many advantages with this hotel: located in the city center (everything on walk can be done), agencies very closed, quiet, ect.... The hotel itself is very nice decorated and I personally I really enjoyed the terrace with the view on the volcano....really beautiful.   The only inconvenient was that other customer were a little bit behaving loudly during night...  Muchas gracias al personal del hotel por su amabilidad',\n \"I stayed 3 nights in this hotel and I could not sleep one night! The staff is friendly but unfortunately they don't do anything if you complain about the noise at 11 or 12 o'clock in the evening ... you can hear every noise and movement in the other rooms and outside, we were also unlucky to have clients in the hotel that did not care about other clients that want to sleep. Do not recommend this hotel if you want some peace and quiet.\",\n 'Although out of the central district of town, the property is lovely with a large garden.  Apparently we were lucky to get an interior room opening to the garden as we overheard from others that exterior room fronting the street was noisy. Room was quite large with a cool dome.  No heat or AC: presumably temp is usually moderate (although reading another review, seems they were too hot.  Going in Dec, the weather was chilly and we were on the cold side). Main drawback is the included breakfast is mediocre at best. Otherwise, staff friendly and helpful.  It is a bit of a hike over uneven cobbled road into town but easy to get taxi or tuk-tuk service at reasonable cost.',\n 'First the positives. The hotel looks great and the grounds are a credit to the team responsible. The location with the restaurant overlooking an active volcano was spectacular, imagine dinner with a backdrop of lava spouting from a volcano. Probably not a daily event, but we were lucky. The hotel should however be better, and lets itself down. The rooms are clean, of a good size but lack air con. You would therefore expect to be able to ventilate by opening the windows, but with no insect screens, this is just not sensible, resulting in a stuffy room. The rooms also have no room safes. Guests can place valuables in security boxes at reception, but with travellers carrying tablets, laptops, cameras, phones etc this is not suitable or practical. It is really not good enough not to',\n \"A very pleasant hotel on the outskirts of the colonial city of Antigua. Lovely gardens, friendly staff and a good restaurant.  Our room was clean and a good size. My only complaint would be that the room was very dark even with the lights on. We walked into the main part of town every day but stayed at the hotel at night to eat after our tour finished, mainly because it the streets weren't well lit and the cobbled roads and sidewalk was very uneven with lots of holes.\",\n 'A very pleasant and nice hotel with relatively large rooms, good food, and a very helpful service. The hotel is built as a colonial villa, spread around very nice gardens, and separate 2-floors small buildings, and a central building with a nicely viewed + balcony dining room.',\n \"We stayed here w/ our three little kids (8, 6, 4). Four blocks from the park and/or La Iglesia de San Francisco.  We stayed in the big suite w two beds.  We were thrilled to have a modest kitchen and hot water.  Okay, it  wasn't 400-year old adobe, but who cares when you have your own washer/dryer and stove?    Someone pointed out earlier that their slusing door wouldn't lock.  We found this to be true in our unit as well.  I ended up using the dustpan handle as a door lock, which worked alright.  I can understand her concern, as the unlocked door expised to the outside was unsettling.  Would we stay again?  Certainly.  Especially for an extended stay.\",\n 'I recently stayed in this hotel in Antigua, about 7 blocks from Central Park, beautiful, cozy two- story villas with washer, dryer, full kitchen, two beds + comfortable sofa bed.  Parking included right in front of the rooms. Would definitely recommend.',\n 'Lovely position and we had a nice room. Glad I was not on the courtyard though with people having breakfast right outside my bedroom window. What was so sad was the poor attitude of the front desk staff. Water was rationed with no attempt to offer filtered water. There was no tea service in the room. Morning tea was fine but any other was undrinkable as the manager either couldn’t or wouldn’t provide hot water. Maybe it was a lack of English but that is also not good enough for the front desk. By the way they charged for it! No effort made to resolve the problem. Plastic flower petals on towels ! Really! Don’t bother ! No turn down service so dirty towels and cups left all night. Not what I would call a “boutique” hotel. More a very average hotel with a label.',\n 'Do not stay here! We booked through booking.com and paid in cash when we checked out. About a month later we noticed that they had charged our Visa card as well. Both San Jeronimo and booking.com are refusing to refund us. They are so many better options in Antigua at a better price. STEER CLEAR!! ',\n 'This hostel provides a bed, at an average price.The location is rather decent; it is where you want to be in Antigua. There was rather a problem with the cold at night and quite a strong smell of disinfectant at times, which at least tells me that some cleaning occurs there. It has little in the way of a social atmosphere and certainly lacks any of kind of usefulness or warmth from the staff. They are neither friendly, nor knowledgeable about the town or transport there. More importantly, during my stay, I began to suffer from the Zika Virus. While the hostel was of no fault there, what was concerning to me was that I was in bed for several days, moaning and looking dreadful, while the staff walked past, unconcerned. I would value some social responsibility.',\n \"We have just arrived here after reserving in advance. The rooms are not as shown in pictures. There is no natural light, some don't even have windows.

Terrible rooms and terrible customer service.\",\n 'Stayed three nights. Unfortunately the room is smaller than it appears in pictures, no natural light and very stuffy air. We had to keep the door open. A lot of noise from the staircase. Staff friendly enough but seem a bit over worked. We often had to wait some minutes to be let in at night after ringing the bell.   Place clean enough, decent location, decent shower. Pretty nice upstairs outside courtyard. There are places which offer better value for money elsewhere.',\n 'The receptionist provided us with little to no information as to the details of the hotel. We had to prompt every time. The room was clean but the walls are so thin that you can hear anyone who may be making some noise.  There is no air con or fan so when it is hot, it is very hot!  Breakfast was not included in our rate despite it saying it on our hotel room door and on our confirmation. When asking the staff about it, it wasnt really her problem so meh!  I would probably pay extra and stay elsewhere next time as Antigua is beautiful and deserves a better experience.',\n 'The rooms are a small box with no ventilation, no air circulation and not even a fan.  You get one tiny window with a \"courtyard\" view.  The shower only got to luke-warm, and they turn the water off periodically at night.   I will say that the staff was generally nice and they did their best to make our stay pleasant.  We had an evening flight, and the staff did let us keep our bags at the hotel after checkout.   This is NOT a luxury place.  It is in a decent location so if you just need a place to crash it might be ok for you.  We visited in December, so thankfully it was cold at night, I imagine it would be impossible to sleep if the temperature was hotter.',\n \"We booked at Monasterio because we got a very good deal through Expedia. I was a bit anxious about it since they only had one previous review. Now I'm glad we stayed here. It's very welcoming and the staff is great! You can tell they are putting a lot of effort to make you feel welcome And that's priceless. We will surely come back when possible.\",\n 'Overall our stay was very good.

The only reason I can't give a 5 is because the wifi is not included however it is something like $2/day, so not very difficult to obtain either! If you stay here, you will be well taken care of! \",\n \"For the price is was decent value. But.... no screens on windows - so mosquiro woke me in the night; onsite bar, across from our room was noisy while trying to sleep; no A/C or fan, so the room was hot; shower didn't turn off and dripped all night.  Will we stay here again - never.  \",\n \"Nice decoration and terrace but they overcharged us when they converted the USD price in a loca currency and they pushed us to consume the difference in the hotel! The service is poor for the price you pay. They didn't give us towels for two , they don't clean the table where you are having breakfast and we also booked a van to the lake but they didn't come in the morning. The girl at the reception was really unfriendly and make us feel unwelcome. I would never come back to this place . With than money you can pay a good hostel I'm sure they will attend you better. \",\n 'Hotel is located in the UN heritage site. It is in the middle of everything ( restaurant, shops and bars).

The staff is very friendly and the lady at the front desk speaks fluent English. If you want luxury and spacious rooms - you will want a different hotel.  If you would like a nice, clean, quiet place to sleep ... its fantastic.  Plus you do get breakfast included in the rate. The hotel is a few blocks from the central park however, on the same street as the Santa Clara ruins, close to Hermano Pedro Church and many amenities.  The walk to central park is only 10 minutes maximum.  Which by the size of Antigua is very reasonable.  Many times we have walked around Antigua after dark.  It is a very safe place and there are a lot of police, tourist security and PMT (traffic police)',\n 'The room is very small, not very clean (dusty). The bed was very uncomfortable and there was hardly any hot water in the shower.',\n \"Casa Noble is very pretty and has really cute and spacious rooms. The staff is nice and the hotel is safe and quiet. The downside is that it's about a 10-15 minute walk from the central area...not a big deal during the day, but it's not recommended to do that walk at night. If you plan to have late evenings (after 10), I'd recommend staying a little closer to the central area (but not too close as it can be really loud, even late at night).\",\n 'We   booked    the    hotel   online   with  Expedia.

I called Casa Noble directly, and Susana (owner/property mgr?) was very helpful over the phone.  I booked two rooms.  I did ultimately see this hotel listed in Lonely Planet with favorable comments.  Upon entering the hotel, there is a beautiful courtyard, and the property looks rather exquiste.  There are also beautiful views of the area volcanoes.  Both of our rooms were on the second floor, and were large.  The room I was staying in did lack some privacy because you had to keep the windows open (few places with AC in highlands), and people walking up the stairs could see into our room, but not the other ones.

The location is safe and convenient, and the breakfast is delicious, it includes the usual black beans, tomato sauce, omelette, pancakes, bread and toasts and a wide variety of extremely fresh fruits. But #1, if your room is on the ground floor, around the courtyard, the noise of the wheels of the luggage on the rocks and the conversations of people unaware of the proximity are not conducive to resting, especially that people gather at 7 right there for breakfast! But #1, there is a problem with the hot water, and there was several cold water showers.',\n 'One of the best hotels I stayed at. Nice staff, good breakfast and they have good coffee and cake in the evenings. Very nice decor.  Location is nice. The view from the rooftop is nice as well. Would definitely stay again!',\n 'Let me start by saying that this hotel has it all: great location, nice breakfast, splendid views from the terrace,... Unfortunately our rooms were not the ones we were waiting for: - The \"standard rooms\" we booked were a tiny 15sqm, not the advertised 20sqm. - The \"suite\" we booked (at double the price of a normal room just to be sure to have 2 separate beds, as advertised on the booking site) did not have 2 separate beds and was not a suite at all (unless you consider a public seating place a part of the room). We were indeed arriving late at the hotel, but that is no reason to give us the \"leftovers\" (we booked months in advance).',\n \"We spent three nights in Room 4 and one night in Room 6 during our stay. The hotel is located right on a busy corner across from a park and a church, but the interior rooms are super quiet. The courtyard is so beautiful, filled with flowering plants, trees, vines, a fountain, and lots of comfortable seating. Birds, including mourning doves, sparrows, and orioles call this place home. We spent many hours chilling there. Breakfast was delicious. Three mornings we had eggs, black beans, salsa, and fried plantains accompanied by bread and coffee/tea and one morning pancakes, fruit spread, and fresh fruit. Service was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. It was quiet during our stay, with only one or two other rooms occupied, so I can't attest to the sound during busy times.\",\n 'Pros:  Good location, friendly staff, good price Cons:  Rooms on the street are very noisy, so you should bring ear plugs or sleep medications.   Noise continues until 12:00 midnight and starts at 4:30 am.   Was also able to hear people in rooms next door.    Breakfast one morning was just toast, jam and fruit.   The next morning eggs and fruit.  The third morning we decided to go to a restaurant and get a more substantial breakfast.    Given that we were in a coffee producing country, i expected good coffee in the mornings.  But this was the worst coffee I’ve ever had.   Very watery and weak.

The room is very spacious    Dislikes:  SUPER THIN WALLS, I heard everything going on late night including extracurricular activities, including the music.

The rooms facing the street are very nice and if you're a people watcher and have a great view of the street below.  It's located  just before the famous arc (so it's almost always busy).  Despite the people, we didn't find it too noisy for a good nights rest (just be sure to close the balcony door)!  What really made this experience great for us was the service.

We celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary in Antigua and the owners gave us a nice bouquet of flowers and delicious gourmet chocolates (a must in Guatemala).

It is an easy walking distance to the Central square, and Cathedral.  Staff is super friendly and helpful.  Rooms were small but clean and with everything you need.  There is an amazingly green plant filled inner courtyard, typical of colonial structures that is cool and welcoming with a huge fountain.  There is also a rooftop terrace that has the most amazing views of Antigua, the volcanoes, everything! The only disappointment was that the booking website we used advertised a pool, and there is none.  Guests can use a pool at another hotel for a fee, but they could have disclosed that.  Overall a great stay.',\n 'A little overpriced perhaps - Q350 - this was on a Friday through Sunday - but a little nice room, well kept and very clean; charming, decent utilities in general. Shower a little underpowered but suffice.  Very nice roof  terrace with perfect view of volcano aqua, fuego and acanetengo.  Shared kitchen that’s well equipped; a nice lady who spoke English which is always so helpful if you are a dufus like me.  WiFi ok, occasionally drops out. Not high speed, though.  Overall, I’d recommend as the location is excellent with some benefits of sister hotels nearby added.',\n \"The staff were wonderful. The girls on the desk could not have been more helpful. But it was a horribly noisy place to stay. Intermittent machinery noises throughout night due to something in courtyard. Also because rooms are around courtyard/garden, people sit there or talk there and it's noisy at night. Rooms are nice but it seems there are better places to stay in price range.\",\n \"On the plus side, this hotel is conveniently located near the center of Antigua. Many businesses around. They keep it clean and the employees try to make you feel good.  On the negative side, rooms are packed in this small location, and you can easily hear outside noises all night. If someone gets in late, you will listen to every word they say. The coffee maker outside my room kept making noises all night.  I can't recommend this place to anyone who's a light sleeper.  \",\n 'Fantastic boutique and historical hotel. Here is the deal...it deserves 5 stars because of its potential and its abundant  character but will not get 5 stars because one has to sacrifice certain creature comforts like AC (it has fans) and older restrooms. But this was one of the oldest buildings in Antigua! The ceilings are like staying in a museum...just stunning. The beds are just what you need and the entire staff is fantastic.  Excellent location.  I could not recommend this hotel night. Especially for larger parties that can book in advance several of their rooms. The courtyard is beautiful and quaint. ',\n 'The location is central, the price is very reasonable, the beds and decor are nice and comfortable.  My only complaint is that we did not have any hot water over the 3 nights we stayed at this property.  We complained about it on several occasions and the hotel tried to fix it (but only after the second complaint), and ultimately could not fix it.   Not a big issue given that it was pretty warm outside when we stayed, but want to point out the issue.',\n 'We definitely enjoyed our stay here. Authentic Antigua! For sure. Which means..very old structure/building, decent facilities, food. Super friendly workers. Reasonable, super-convenient Guatemala City airport pickup. Rooms are fine.

The Posada is within walking distance of a lot of the restaurants, bars, and the market of Antigua.   The staff working at both Posadas are really helpful, and will cater to your need were you to have any.

Once I had dinner indoors within minutes my takeaway box was swarmed with tiny ants. Pretty gross. Also when I checked in there was multiple blonde hairs in one of the bed. The other had stains.

The cosy little lounge has complementary hot drinks always available and if not hot enough, the super- friendly staff are always on hand to make more.

This should have been notified to us beforehand, since receptionist agreed that it was very noisy room and this complaint was common.

Average breakfast (chapin, traditional).  If you want to take a shuttle you should know that it's more than probable that you'll be the first in the bus. Great, you can choose your seat...

Staff friendly and helpful...out of a gazillion hotels in Antigua this appears to be a reliable option, and we would return.

We were told that they were upgrading us to their other property the Euro Maya Suites where the rooms were nicer apparently, after a quick check online I found out that to stay at the Euro Maya Suites it was indeed a little bit more expensive. BUT the reason I booked the Euro Maya was more for the location and the rooftop terrace which the other one didn't have.

It finally got quiet around 1.30 am only for the  noise to start again around 3am as guests woke up presumably for early morning pick ups and hikes. For us it was too expensive for failing to provide decent sleep.   In addition the WiFi was really poor most of the time.

Housekeeping was very good but never came when they said they were coming and security was there. The beds were very very comfortable and their was good hot water.  There is a safe in the room which was great, but not sure if you could fit a full sized lap top in it.  For my I-pad it was perfect.  Wireless access was pretty reliable.  Even when I lost access it came back quickly.  Negative:  It's very noisy.  If no-one is on either side of you, it's okay, otherwise you hear everything.  Several times there were people partying quite loudly and went I spoke to the security guard, he spoke to the tenants but nothing changed. \",\n \"Our second time coming back in Antigua. After the recent experience of one hotel we had before, and barely space for the bags we book a triple room.  We booked the room through booking.com.

Friendly staff - however, Pablo and Luis don't speak English but tried their best to understand you.  We have the room on the upper floor next to a housekeeping room. At night we hear the laundry machine turning. It bothers me, as I'm not a good sleeper.  The room is okay but there mold on the ceiling. Good free wifi. The bathroom is small, not very clean.

As Posada offered this option and had availability - I booked - it was a GREAT DECISION.  The airport arrival can be overwhelming with the many taxi drivers lurking, and hoards of people waiting to welcome their family members. Our driver has a big clear sign and was an absolute delight!   The drive to Antigua is around 45 mins from the airport. We were thankful to have the hotel transfer as if you're not familiar with where you are, the dark drive can be daunting.  The receptionist was helpful and quick to respond on emails. The room\",\n 'The hotel is quaint, secure, and centrally located. The beds were comfortable, but the cleanliness of our sheets was questionable (stains and hair.) There are windows in the rooms that look into the garden common space, so the airflow in the room was limited, but there was a fan provided. The water pressure was good one day but the next day we had no running water (not sure if this was a freak accident or a common occurrence.) For our 24 hour stay in Antigua, this hotel did the job but will not be too memorable.',\n \"There were 3 of us sharing a room. Each had our own bed. It was clean and basic. The bathroom was a tight fit with only the one mirror. To get hot water, do not turn the pressure on too high. The staff were very kind and accommodating when we asked to move our room downstairs so we wouldn't have to carry our luggage up the narrow stairs.  It is near the center plaza with more than enough places near to eat and shop. Great for walking everywhere.\",\n 'My three young daughters and i stayed in El Marques over Semana Santa.  We were able to walk into town to enjoy the festivities and easily return to El Marques to relax.  The unit was clean, well appointed, and had all of the amenities we needed.  The on-site security and administrative staff were extremely helpful and kind.  They arranged transportation for us, directed us to a variety of activities, advised us on restaurants, and answered our many questions.  We will stay there again!',\n \"Too bad TripAdvisor doesn't allow audio uploads with their reviews.

But on closer inspection you soon realise this place was once some dirty hotel that has been made to look nice by painting a wall or two, adding a mood light, a nice design bed sheet... taking some nice photos like you see here, on the FB page. The reality is that the rooms are very dirty, it looked like my floor has not been cleaned in a long time. The bathroom was also bad and no hot water, eventually a bit warm but still a freezing shower. It is also very noisy because it's by the main street. I was in a room furthest away but if anyone talks at reception the noise is amplified by the design of the hotel.

Regular breakfast and the waiters service need improvement.',\n \"Old style hotel on the outskirts of Antigua with excellent views of the surrounding volcanoes from the terrace restaurant. Good clean accommodation although a little basic. Friendly and helpful staff. Restaurant was a little more expensive than restaurants in town which are approx 20-30 mins walk away down Antigua's iconic cobbled streets. Slightly irritated that the hotel charges for bottled drinking water on the rooms and as previously noted some rooms on the exterior of the courtyarded garden suffer from road noise. Small bathing pool to ease those aching legs after a hard day sightseeing \",\n \"As recommended by my guide, I feel the cost of my stay was well worth it.  It's a bit of a walk from the city center (far NE corner of the area where most tourists roam), but definitely not an issue.  Christian and his staff were very accommodating and a pleasure to talk to.  Since part of the hotel is set up like a hostel, there is no shortage of conversation in the outside common area with interesting guests.  I enjoyed watching a local artist paint wall murals near the bunk rooms.  There's also a beautiful garden near the private rooms, and you can catch a nap outside easily if so inclined.  My only issue was I had a bit of trouble keeping warm in the room at night, and would say that the rooms might not be as well insulated as you would expect when the temperature gets down\",\n 'My bed was so hard that my wife took the other single bed as she could not sleep on the hard double. Lucky for her as I endured multiple bed bug bites and she got away scott free. Still itching now as I write this. Expedia promised 15m2 but had a room size of thimble but the great staff sorted it next day. Thanks. Roof top is great for breakfast. Kitchen good for basic meal only. Good for the price.',\n \"Overall the hotel was nice and the service was great. However you do NOT want to be iin Room 101 (or I would suggest 102 or 103) as these are right by the courtyard used for breakfast (set up starts at 05:30am) also any visitors arriving or leaving during the night will wake you. Also for Room 101 the window from the hotel toilet opens out into your bathroom - again noise by anyone using it overnight. Finally if you are there on a Saturday night the live rock band playing at the pub next door is effectively the other side of the wall to this room. We asked to be moved but were told there weren't any suitable rooms available. This was clearly untrue as we saw rooms come and go that were suitable and in a more quite location of the hotel.   All of that said if you aren't in rooms\",\n 'We made a reservation for the only location listed, located just off the Calle del Arco. When we arrived, a gentleman told our driver to take us to the \"other\" location. It was a decent location. The bathrooms were nice, breakfast was good. The best was comfortable. My frustration was that it was not the location we wanted. It was further from the center. Nor was it as charming.',\n 'As this place is so similar to their sister property, Euro Maya Suites, you may see a lot of similarity in reviews.  I returned to Antigua and decided to try this, the older sister, as it was only half a block from The Plaza.  A beautiful small hotel with an excellent staff and nice rooms.   With all the knick-knacks around it could also be a museum. The quirky intermingling of Mezoamerican artifacts and photos of European cities is strange; depending on how you look at it you may consider it charming or annoying.  My room was above average size and comfortable although there was only one somewhat easy chair, and no sofa, so two people would have some difficulties when it came to relaxation. The bathroom was adequate and it had hot water in the shower without having bare wiring',\n 'There was some confusion getting here, we thought we had booked the Euro Maya Suites but ended up at this location after calling to confirm.  Ok, fine.  The room was okay, pretty cramped.  The biggest issue is not only is there no AC, but also no overhead fan and the hotel has no fans to bring it.  It was so stuff and even leaving all windows open for cross-breeze, it was really stuffy.  It was nice to have breakfast on the roof and the breakfast was super plentiful and served by lovely staff.  Location is tops.',\n 'Gorgeous spacious rooms, with a nice tipico breakfast included. The all day complimentary coffee, tea and purified water was very convenient to have. Centrally located.  Unfortunately the shower water was cold.  Be sure to let the front desk know if you plan to return late at night, as we were locked out, despite using the door bell and calling the front desk, exhausted, we had to find alternate accommodations in the middle of the night.  After explaining this to the staff the next morning, we were refunded the fee for the night. ',\n \"We spent two nights here on our way to Lake Atitlan for a service trip.

The public areas were pretty. Wifi worked in our room amd the breakfast area. I wouldn't stay here again.\",\n 'Spent one night and would not return. The downstairs room was subjected to noisy chatter by patrons all night long and even in the early morning (0400). There is a charge for everything - wifi, water.

We have stayed at several hotels in Antigua and have always been very pleased with staff, service and accommodations at other hotels in the area.   This hotel has been the worst we have stayed at by far in this price range.  The receptionist was accommodating but slightly rude.  Definitely not friendly or personable and the staff acted like they didn't know what they were doing most of the time.  We stayed for two nights and politely asked if it was possible to change rooms after the first night because our room was located right next to reception desk which was very noisy and loud from people checking in and out all through the day and night we could not sleep.  The first room was very comfortable and\",\n \"My sister and I stayed at Hotel Casa del Parque recently and we had a wonderful visit. The hotel is very centrally located, within a few steps to the central park (where many restaurants, cafe's and shops are located) and artisanal markets.

The pool was great - very refreshing and so appreciated after a day of sightseeing.

The only complaint - no blow dryer available....Very cooperative when asking to leave suitcase or anything else.',\n \"Beautiful little hotel close to Central Park. I needed some peace and quiet and chose this hotel for the beautiful rooms and courtyard. The price was quite reasonable compared to other hotels in the area.

All in all, a great stay.\",\n 'This place was clean and the staff was so helpful! They helped us find places we wanted to go and gave great recommendations!

It is just 2 blocks from the main square and there is traffic, but we kept our windows closed and weren't disturbed. We were offered a cooked, or continental breakfast (which is included in the rate) and ate on their very pretty patio.   We heard no noise from other rooms and my only gripe would be that the bedrooms need more illumination. Hopefully they could do that tastefully without breaking up the colonial decor.   If you are considering this property, be aware that they have a sister hotel called the Palacio Chico 1940, so don't book the wrong hotel. Don’t know why this property sits so low in the TA listings, it is a good option for travelers\",\n 'We stayed here on our final night in Antigua the staff could not have been nicer they answered loads of questions for us and sorted an airport shuttle. The room was spotless and the shuttered windows ensured a solid nights rest. It is a little expensive for what you get in terms of breakfast which was only 2 pieces of toast, 2 small slices of watermelon and pineapple. We asked for eggs which they gave.   Bottled water was free and it is in a nice quiet area of the town.

Staff actually tried to imply I had lost items / not locked door/ fabricated the incident. The lack of assistance was as bad as the invasion of privacy, particularly for a young solo female traveller - 'Hotel' is actually a large house with rooms rented out - Was told no one else had keys to my room but staff later admitted the owner had a key - Local authorities i.e. the tourism police are very helpful\",\n \"The rooms were clean and nice.

The hotel del Marques features exclusively suites, we booked a large suite for 6 persons equipped with a kitchen,  and a washer & dryer all of which proved very useful!

The room was furnished simply, but it was very adequate.  We had a lower floor room, but I think upstairs might be quieter.  There is no air conditioning, so the upper floor might be pretty warm in the summer.',\n 'It’s on the outside of town which means large coaches can stop here so groups like it and although at night on the whole it’s quieter than sleeping in town as it also caters for functions and we had one evening where we were disturbed by a band quite late into the night.  Add to this the tour groups arriving and departing in the nighttime hours and voices and suitcases bumping along the cobbles reverberating around the complex and it doesn’t always make for a peaceful sleep.  It looks OK on the surface and is tastefully done up to look like an old colonial town and has a nice courtyard garden area but it lacks charm or personality, the staff aren’t particularly friendly, the rooms are rather dated and certainly the ground floor ones smelt damp and needed airing, and the beds',\n 'I stayed for two nights with my family in late December.  The hotel setting (grounds, buildings, ambiance) is five stars and amazing.  Kudos to the hotel for improving the museums, which are really interesting and worth a visit whether or not you stay at this hotel.  However, the food and room were not too impressive- three stars.  The room smelled smoky as there was a fireplace and a little card that instructed people not to have fires... well, then maybe you should take out the wood of the fireplace so that people do not light fires!  We had two meals at the hotel- an average breakfast with very slow service and sandwiches at the pool, which were not very good. All in all, an enjoyable 2 days, but the hotel could do better.',\n 'It was nicely located just 5min from city. Nice to have breakfast on the rooftop. Rooms and hotel was quite nice.

The best thing about this hotel is the very central placement - only one block away from the very nice square Placa Central.

Anyway - is you are there to see the city is is at perfect place for only a few days.',\n 'This hotel was a great place to stay in Antigua. It was central to everything, the park, markets, restaurants and bars. It has  the old colonial feel to it. The beds and pillows comfortable, great WiFi, hot water, free drinking water, free coffee and tea. Beer for sale in cooler, cheap price. Nice courtyard and a top terrace with great views. Very secure. The best though is the staff was very friendly and helpful. The only down side, is that the terrace needs new cushions for chairs and to be more inviting, so much potential there. We would definitely stay there again. Oh ya and they store your stuff for you if you are coming back as we did after spending a week at Lago de Atitlan.',\n 'I was hoping to stay at another smaller hotel but it was fully booked for the dates we wanted so we ended up staying here.

The hotel staff charged $1 per bag for storage, which is ridiculous. They coordinate with the tour operator for the cost of the room, and knew we would be out for two separate nights, and still charged us. The menat the front desk were apologetic.

Really close to the city square, great pubs and food and very easy to navigate around.   The view on the rooftop at night was my favourite!

The rooms are reasonable size with good facilities - a great shower and bed. We did not have breakfast included so went out each morning (there are some great options nearby.

The proximity to the park square makes it easy to enjoy the sights and dining in Antigua.',\n 'My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights (3 before a tour and 2 with a tour). The hotel was very clean, the terrace was lovely and staff were friendly and helpful. The place seemed quite secure as the front doors were locked at all times and you had to buzz to get in. We originally had a room by the roadside and it was a bit noisy in the early morning, but we were able to change rooms given it was low season. The hot water works, but requires a bit of patience.

Bathroom inside the room and a little TV. The hotel isn’t quiet, the noise starts around 5am and that kept our puppy up since.

I caught her peeking at me through the window as I was leaving the kitchen area. I noticed she was pretty rosy with the other guests though.

',\n 'After we booked to stay in this hotel, we were then contacted by the owners to say that they had since upped their prices for the Easter week we were staying there. We were literally told we were out unless we agreed to pay their revised price. Highly unprofessional. They made the mistake and yet they tried to make us pay for it. On top of that, they delayed telling us leaving us even less choice with where to go on a very popularly booked week of the year in Guatemala. Any hotel worth its salt would never do this imho. Book at your peril.',\n \"A nice hostel for those who want a quiet place with a relaxing atmosphere and home feeling. Have a small roof top terrace with look to Fuego Vulcano.

We were greeted within 30 seconds by the Owner/Operator named Christian, and he is the nicest guy in town. The atmosphere of the Hostel was definitely more relaxed the first night (Thursday), and the crowd picked up for the Friday/Saturday nights. However, it’s definitely NOT a typical “party“ Hostel. They do have a wide selection of cheap and delicious beers, and it’s a great vibe for hanging out but we always got a great night sleep as it tends to quiet down around 1030-11.

Christian at the front desk was very helpful and found us a new hotel and we thank him for that. The hotel did not reimburse or compensate us in any way.

On the main drag between the arch and the main square, is this tiny gem. Our room was clean and comfortable, and we loved the common space. The breakfasts were the best we had in a week in Guatemala! And Maria even came early one day to make us breakfast before an early departure. The hosts were pleasant and accommodating and willing to make recommendations.

However, some aspects are not good, for example the outside noise, because the hotel is very close to the street and the external noises of public transportation are heard from early in the morning.

When they didn't have available rooms, they referred me here and it was a completely different experience.\",\n \"I had been travelling for 17 hours on shuttle and got there and they were probably a bit too strict for my liking. Couldn't even go to the kitchen to make myself a cup of tea before bed as it shuts ridiculously early. Though I must say it is a clean, safe and reliable Hostal. I just didn't enjoy my time there now. Also I myself am not a smoker but note you will have to leave the hostel and go into the street to smoke.\",\n \"Stayed 3 nights with my partner in a double ensuite room. Rooms are small, clean & comfortable. This is a small & quiet hostel and in an excellent location. There's a St Martin bakery just across the road, and lots of bars and restaurants nearby. Definitely a good choice if you're looking for budget accommodation. Nice views of the volcano from the terrace but unfortunately they shut it early. Wifi ok. Staff friendly - they organised early transportation to the airport in Guatemala City for us.\",\n 'We stayed 3 nights , the staff are very kind, the host speak fluently english and was very helpful with everything.  Location is a bit far from center town (4-5 min walk) but no big issue..  The price is high  for a private room even though we got a discount for long stay.. hot water is tricky  , breakfast includes and was awesome!! Free water fill and a ping pong table :)',\n \"Think it was run by a Californian family, the boy that was on reception was very cute and appeared to run the whole hostel in a very organised, professional and efficient manner. He was welcoming, attentive and helpful - a credit to the hostel. The rooms were clean and came with fluffy blankets which was a nice addition. Advertised as hot showers but we didn't have a hot one during our stay - not sure why? The free breakfast included is great. The pancakes were large and very tasty. If you want a different breakfast or to add or remove something from your dish they are very accommodating. Best free coffee served during breakfast too!! The wifi works really well and it's only a short 5 min walk into the Central Park and 900metres away from the lookout so great spot. \",\n 'Casa Encantada was a great place to stay. It’s not far from the center of Antigua and I felt completely safe. The hotel is very small and you will not find the amenities of a larger hotel. But every person that worked the front desk greeted me by name every time I saw them, which is something you don’t normally get. The hotel also has a sister property up the street and all guests at Casa Encantada can use their facilities (pools, retaurants etc.)  I’ve read other reviews that complain about how noisy it is. And it’s true you do hear noise coming from the street. But I also stayed at a higher end hotel during my trip and had the same problem. Noise is just normal here. If you need complete silence when you sleep then I would suggest bringing earplugs.   Thanks Casa Encantada.',\n \"First,  the new woman who runs the place is very nice and very helpful.  BUT, this place is no longer a quiet hotel but a hostel.  People were chatting in the courtyard until I finally asked them to stop at 2:30.  As a hostel I'm sure it is fine, but I would not recommend it for quiet.  It's also not as clean as it used to be.\",\n 'We stayed at the lovely Casa Santo Domingo. Arriving here is so nice.   Especially in the evening when all candles are lit, it is a very elegant place to arrive to after flying into busy Guatemala city. All of Antigua is so beautiful and worth a visit when in Guatemala.   We liked staying at this hotel very much. The rooms were nicely connected and located in a quiet area of the Hotel. The hotel is also a museum which is an amazing additional facility as walking through the hotel is truly fascinating. The staff is very kind, although less than 50% speaks basic English. Rooms were nice, hotel’s pool is child-friendly. Spa facilities were nice, massage was very good. Location is excellent. Restaurant was nice, room service was great. We can recommend staying here with children.',\n \"Left after they changed a confirmed rate, try to steal credit card informations found policies which were not right, the staff looks really incompetent, told me first by credit card they would reserve $100, after I refused they told me on debit card they can authorize $ 200, I refused so they told me I can deposit $200, cash also that I refused he called the manager which was hiding somewhere, he told me they will make an acception and do not charge me, I agreed but they make a copy of my card on a paper so that's fraud and not authorized data theft, specially I refused since beginning. Take care that they not steal your data and check rates on booking.com as they try to trick you on prices.\",\n \"Pretty, comfortable and clean. Upstairs loft large bedroom and bed and downstairs sitting room and bath.  Shower had drain problems that were addressed by removing drain lid.  Breakfast (or sac lunch) okay and appropriate.  Thin walls and not thoughtful guests a problem (and chicken bus callers in early am), otherwise a quiet and convenient location. Weak WIFI modem (I requested  a close room from other reviews) only had signal downstairs or in lobby, not in bedroom.  I was only in room from 6 pm to 7 am because of work.  Travel agent in lobby on weekends (? weekdays) was great for excursions.  All staff were friendly and very willing to help, but many didn't speak or barely spoke English.  Alicia Estrada was the main desk staff person who spoke English well, always smiled, and\",\n \"Built in the traditional style around a central courtyard, this hotel has both noise and air circulation problems. The surrounds are quiet at night, but all it takes is one guest or group doing something as simple as having a chat outside their room, and everyone can hear it. Once the windows are closed there is no air circulation and the room becomes quite humid. Bed was reasonably comfortable, but the polyester blanket increased the discomfort caused by poor air circulation. The hottest the water got was tepid. Room was clean and spacious and breakfast was perfectly adequate.  There are no facilities for the secure safekeeping of passports and valuables. If you're catching an early flight - ours was the 6.30 to Flores - consider a taxi or private shuttle. The 4am shuttle\",\n \"I think the place is appropriate.  Great location. Half a block away from the central park.  Had an issue with hot water the first day I was there.  No hot water after coming back from climbing pacaya. Had to take a cold water shower. Staff was accomodating but not being able to count on hot water is a problem. Got it resolved. Thank you.  Front rooms are noisy. And don't let them give you the room above reception. No pool. Breakfast was good. I'm fine with black beans, plantains, and some eggs. No hot water on the bathroom sink. So shaving for guys is tricky if you use a blade.  Consider how many people have submitted reviews for this hotel. \",\n 'Stayed here (not Euro Maya Suites) for one night but would have enjoyed more nights had my itinerary allowed.  The room was pleasant, the bed comfortable and included a couch/foton..  There is a big window at the front of the room and one at the rear that opened to an adjoining building.  The room has an LCD TV with a variety of free channels and pay per view.  The bathroom was good sized and included a hair blower; hot water was available almost instantaneously.   The building has ample places to sit and relax outside any room.  Tables and chairs are positioned on the walkway around the atrium which provides an open air feel.   Breakfast was provided in a nice cozy little dining area but was unremarkable.  Juice, coffee, breads, and cold cereal were served.  With more guests',\n 'I just stayed here with my family in November and I absolutely LOVED this place.  The rooms are so nice, with huge flat screen tvs, amazing showers, and comfortable beds.  It has an excellent atmosphere and included breakfast.  It is close to everything, and super clean.  The only complaint is that we could hear some noise on the street in the morning, but that was completely overshadowed by how wonderful our room was.  We had a two story loft, and it was gorgeous.  I am from Guatemala City but live in the U.S., I would definitely recommend this hotel.  Great prices and overall wonderful stay.',\n 'We have stayed here many times. Always treated like family by Luis (owner) and Hugo (#1 back up to Luis) and Clara (housekeeping and more). This was one of our longest stays (7 nights). We were treated to an eruption by the volcano Fuego. About 11 miles distant and the wind was in our favor. Great viewing from the roof. The place is as eclectic as always. Very reasonable. Close to central square (1-1/2 blocks). Convenient to most everything else.',\n 'Greetings all!  Here it is in a nutshell.  Overpriced.  Room too small to accommodate a single persons luggage.  No place to hang clothes.  One spigot of cold water in the sink.  Spider on my towel, on removing it the rack fell to the floor.  Room  behind kitchen bad due to chatty cooks at 6 am.  Today second day, loud music at 6 am.  No rest for the weary.  Minimal breakfast offered so ate out.  Staff good!  For the money you can do much better!  Try Hotel San Jorge, cheaper, and much better.  Would not stay here again.  If not for lost luggage by United, delivered 44 hours after arrival, I would have moved. Mosquitoes in room.  No screens on window.',\n 'As you enter the courtyard, you are assailed by a collection of plants, pictures, memorabilia, and icons.  It is visually fascinating to walk around this hotel.  Antiques and oddities are perched harmoniously though the halls, up the stairs, and out to the roof top patio.  The communal kitchen is clean, and cozy.  The rooms were super quiet and spacious - and the restrooms were spotless with lovely hot water!  We had a small balcony where we could peek out at the stars...',\n \"I stayed there on December 27 and 28, 2013.  It's a very small hotel and that was one of the reasons we wanted to stayed there.  We were 30 of us so we rented the whole hotel , but when we got there they had only 5 out the 7 rooms reserved for us. We should of known then that it wasn't going to be a good experience.  The rooms were not what they said and advertise in the internet, one of the rooms had no running water so the bathroom was not working , none of the rooms had potable water other rooms had no tv in total they were not to the quality we were expecting. The worst part the hotel is being run by a Colombian woman maned ROCIO who has no business ethic she plain stole money from us by asking us for more money when we complained about the lack of services and such. It is\",\n 'we had a great stay here for one night.  good location, friendly staff and a hotel with lots of character and a lovely central courtyard.  price was good value and included breakfast continental style.  recommend it.',\n 'I spent one night in La Antigua, upon arrival in spite  of having made reservations for a room with two queen beds I had to pay for an extra room because the hotel does not have rooms with two queen beds. Having a print out of my reservation that clearly stated my request and confirmation was useless. The restaurant is not very good.',\n \"Rooms are very clean but small, bathroom is split into three (shower, sink and WC) where a built in wardrobe would have been, making it impossible to have privacy. Bar next door hosts a karaoke night during the week, this continues until the early hours and with poor induration and no double glazing we were up till 1am. Pool doesn't have many loungers and can be very loud when families are around. Great view of the volcanos makes up for the 3 star review.\",\n \"We stayed here with two children aged 6 and 10, and we had a lovely time.  It's a small place and not overly luxurious, but the gardens are beautiful, the location is perfect, the staff was very helpful, and the room was very comfortable.  Breakfast by the pool with a view of the volcano in the background was a perfect way to start each day.  The pool is small and a little chilly, but the kids still enjoyed it.The shower wasn't great, either the water pressure or the drainage, but that wasn't a big deal.  The only real problem, as others have said, was the noise.  Weeknights were just fine, but the one weekend night we were there it was even worse than I had imagined, and we had a second floor room away from the street. We closed all our room windows, used our phones as white\",\n 'Excellent location and service overall.  I enjoyed the daily breakfast that was available when you wanted it.   Only downside is that the room itself lacked privacy (thin walls) and the church bells every morning (early) were a bit annoying.  It is a small price to pay for a great location.',\n \"We spent three nights here.  While it was okay, it was not what was promised in its write up.  If there was a gallery, it's long gone.  So is the wine tasting and sales and so is the breakfast, which is included, but served at a coffee shop three doors down.  The mattress was in need of  replacement, sheets and towels were clean and newer. One can see that at one time, it had a lot of promise but money or enthusiasm has waned in it's maintenance.\",\n \"I have stayed at this Hotel three times. Each time I was with a large group (18 people). The rooms were clean, everything was in walking distance and they were very friendly. I have thought about going to another Hotel when I return next year but I won't because I love this one.\",\n \"Very friendly staff that are knowledgeable of the area, and will help out with any questions you have. Rooms are barebones, which is perfect if you just need a place to clean up and sleep like I did. Right around the corner from central park and the market. The only real downside is a large group that came in and kept slamming their doors whenever they left. Some kind of door dampers installed would be a great way to cut out the noise from rowdier neighbors. Aside from that, I didn't hear any noise from the local clubs/parties going on.\",\n 'This hotel has a friendly staff who can help with your questions about getting around Antigua. This is a big plus if you are on your first trip to Antigua. It is very close to parque central and many other highly visited areas. We found the room to be basic and clean but very noisy.  This hotel is also used for a language school so there were many young people there.',\n 'We received a small room on the first floor with private bath. Pretty basic but nice enough. Rooms have a window facing the hall that let in all the outside noise. We were woken up multiple times by loud guests.  Has a nice courtyard, dining area and lounge area.',\n 'Comfortable hotel at a fair price. Rooms are clean and adequate. The hotel feels very secure and it in a good location - between the market and the main square, with many restaurants just around the corner. Fast wifi and a strong signal in the rooms. This is a good choice for couples looking for a nice place to crash in Antigua.',\n \"We were there last month and we thought its location was great. Just a short five minute walk from the Mercado de Artesanias and from the famous arch. The hotel itself is small. The rooms are of decent size. The bathrooms definitely need a little attention. They don't have a parking area, but they did recommend a parking area at another hotel that was also a short walk away.  The service was nice and friendly. We arrived late and went in and out a couple of times during the night and they were always ready to see if we needed any help.   Pros: Excellent location Friendly service Great wifi connection (better than other wifi connections in Guatemala)  Cons: Bathrooms No parking  I would stay here again :) \",\n 'We booked 5 out of the 8 rooms for our group and we had a blast! The staff is very nice and the rooms are adequate and very clean. The courtyard on ground floor served as our \"living room\". We would all sit down there and visit in the evenings and mornings. The had a refrig to store food in and we had use of a toaster oven and microwave oven. It was perfect for our group! Every morning the volcano had a different look and my daughter took a picture of it daily! We stayed upstairs and would leave our windows and door open to let the air flow through.',\n \"We stay only for 1 night and ran away from this bad place. The girl in the front desk promised us a hot water, but it wasn't right. The water was ice cold!! The room was dirty, the sheets and towels were stained and we had a huge spider in the room. Plus, it was noisy at night due to a bar next door. We had a terrible night and run away in the morning. For this amount of money (32$ per night and in weekend even More!!) you better looking for another place.\",\n 'We have enjoyed our visits lately to Hotel Posada San Vicente...good rates, clean rooms, hot showers and very close to all things good in town.  The roof deck provides a wonderful panoramic view of the city, especially at sunrise and sunset!!',\n 'We stayed 5 nights here. The rooms are quaint but the courtyard a bit noisy. The hotel hosted several large groups. My parents had to change rooms to accommodate other people. Their second bed was \"itchy\" but I hate to speculate why. Access to the kitchen was useful for leftovers. Terrace had great 360 views of the city and volcanos, including the very active El Fuego. ',\n \"We were disappointed with Posada San Vincente - for what we were paying we really expected much better.  Hot water was limited and not really ever properly hot. The courtyard is very noisy. Rooms are small and not well ventilated. There were two small soaps but the place doesn't even supply shampoo. We just felt like we were constantly getting ripped off by the place.  We booked the airport transfer and we drove around picking people up at their respective hotels and waiting for guests to arrive from other transfers for 1 hour and 15 minutes before we actually got on the road to the airport so make sure you leave a wide margin of time.  The wifi did work fine for us and the rooftop terrace is nice for the view.\",\n 'I spent a few nights at this hotel recently, and it was a perfect home base for our time in Antigua. It was a short walk to most of the main tourist sites and near a great grocery store. The hotels courtyard is truly lovely and brimming with healthy plants. Kudos to the gardener!  Our double room was on the 2nd floor, and it was simple and clean. Daily housekeeping did a great job. My favorite thing about this hotel is the rooftop terrace - The 360 views of the volcanoes are amazing. Agua, Fuego and Acatenango are easily visible (if the weather is clear) and there is a nice view of Saint Joseph Cathedral as well. A perfect spot to enjoy a relaxing afternoon break from exploring.   Everyone on staff was friendly and welcoming. The only criticism I have is that there was little',\n 'We visit the place a couple w 2 small kids. Arrived late. We asked before the hotel to stay on the ground floor. When we came at midnight with two sleeping kids from the airport. The guy insist to put us on 2nd floor. No elevator. He insist there is no room down. What was wrong. After I insist to be on the ground floor, as I ask few days before he gave us this small room.  I liked the yard and the location. Shower Ammm what to say. Funky head and not really hot. In general Beautiful small yard. Central place. The room very small. But clean. Most of the team lovey. Tv old style.  And can be noisy from the room around. ',\n 'It’s an ok hostel. It’s a little tired in places and sadly not the cleanest. I had to change beds as I woke up with bites after the first night.   The kitchen is alright and has pots and pans. Cutlery and plates are a little battered and the lack of good cleaning products means that people can’t / don’t really clean things thoroughly.   It has a good social vibe and nightly events. Good for tours and shuttles.   We stayed somewhere else on our way back through Antigua. ',\n \"I booked here specifically because I was told it was quiet. When I saw my room was far from the busy street noise outside I figured it would be a good nights sleep. Unfortunately the BLARING TV was on until 10:30pm then turned back on at 7AM. It was an exceptionally unpleasant way to wake up. When I went to complain at the front desk I saw there were actually 2 TV's on and no guests were present! I got the girl at reception to turn off 1, but she seemed like she could have cared less and went back to watching her show.  Then I go to order the free breakfast (burned pancakes, no butter, gross marmalade, ) & they have ....techno blaring in the garden. Sorry, but I paid extra to get a nice experience not to hear some random TV commercials and your terrible music. The room was fine.\",\n \"Nice place. Clean and very spacious. Comfortable beds, hot showers and free breakfast. Nice TV lounge and helpful staff. The dorms only have 6 beds in them and so are nice. Around are several stores for food and drink and restaurants. It is a 5 minute walk to the Central Park. It's about an easy 10 minute walk to the public bus park and market. Free WiFi. Thoroughly recommended.\",\n 'I have to be honest I was expecting a bit more based on the photos and description, but we still had a comfortable 2 night stay here. The photos must have been taken some time ago as the rooms are now a bit tired (dirty carpet, mould on walls and dead mosquitoes squashed on walls).  However, the courtyard is nice and they have a parrot by reception too! Nice location on a quiet street but only a 5 minute walk from the main square. Breakfast isn’t included though as it states on here, it is extra. Free coffee and drinking water was nice though! ',\n \"This is not a good choice.....i was put into a room next to a gate where they had ppl going back and forth with all kinds of equipment etc.   It was scary....also...the girl at the desk could not get off the cell phone to pay any attention to any guests.....just a crappy hotel....far from the center and has nothing to offer....at all.....don't bother folks.....you're better off in a hostel.....lol\",\n 'Lovely garden and roof terrace with a great view. Kind and friendly staff. Very good bed. The room gets cleaned every day. Not the best shower, but warm which was nice. Breakfast is okay. Location is great! ',\n 'We stayed here three nights in total. One night in the ground floor where the room was rather chilly and two nights on 1st floor which was much nicer. There is a lot of traffic noise. But the location is good and facilities good. The breakfast is excellent 30 Qz  ie £3 a eggs benedict with cheese and ham ,granola, yogurt, fresh fruit a roll and toast and unlimited coffee. For us the added bonus was the view of Volcano del Fuego emiting smoke and larva and Yolanda giving us a Spanish lesson . A good experience. ',\n 'There are loads of lovely alternatives so this is not somewhere you need to stay !    As with other reviews , the noise is unbelievable across the Central open  Courtyard !  The rooms are incredibly basic and bare light bulbs !   The staff are disinterested and unhelpful   There are so many nice places to stay in Antigua this is not one of them ! ',\n 'The exterior spaces are nice but the rooms are very basic and I’d struggle to say anything nice about them. It’s a little further out of the town so I’d say it’s better to spend a few extra dollars for a better location.',\n 'We stayed here for 4 nights in Dec 2017. Hotel staff friendly & welcoming, the staff spoke English & appreciated my efforts to speak Spanish! Hotel is in a quiet location but neat the main plaza, lovely courtyard. Breakfast served on the roof  terrace by attentive staff, breakfast was lovely. Fabulous views from roof terrace, especially when a volcano in the distance began to  emit smoke/ash...very exciting ! Rooms clean but fairly basic. Hot water does take a while to come through in the shower....so wait!! If needed, the hotel can arrange for your laundry to be done for you if you are there for a couple of days.',\n \"I just stayed one night.  The location is good - six blocks from the central plaza and very quiet.  The free breakfast is decent and the large courtyard is nice.  The showers are cold, however, despite having electric shower heads (I talked to others and they couldn't get hot water, either).  Antigua mornings can be chilly and a cold shower was not welcome! The workers were all very kind and helpful!\",\n 'We stayed 3 nights at Los Enquentros. We had the suite on the first floor with direct access onto the roof terrace. The ground floor rooms look a bit small and dark but are much cheaper. The decor is quirky and old fashioned but we had plenty of space and everything was clean and comfortable. The shower was hot as long as you turn it up very gently. I enjoyed sitting on the roof early in the morning and watching the birds visit with the volcanos in the background. Breakfast was nice and the owner, Irma, could not have been more helpful. The location is great, being just a few blocks from the Parque Central.',\n \"This place is definitely not ideal. It's very dirty, the sound proofing is extremely bad, and the lady's common areas are a hoarder's paradise. We were glad to get out of here. Only upside is that the lady is very nice and helpful. Still would not recommend it.\",\n \"We crashed here one night before leaving for the airport.  We go to Guatemala rather frequently and wanted to stay somewhere other than GC.  The manager lady (I don't remember her name) was fabulous.  She was up with us when we came in, and then up again when we left.  We were able to pay in American dollars, and we were able to include the cab ride to the airport the next morning.  (A tip- tell them your flight leaves 30 minutes before it actually does.  Our cab driver was at least a half hour late picking us up, and we had a nail biting drive to the airport.  Good thing the flight was delayed.)The hotel was sprawling with lots of courtyards and a rooftop terrace.  The rooms were good sized and clean.  Same with the bathroom.  The shower has that electric water heater that most\",\n 'I went to a wedding and a table collapsed on me full of glass vases. Could of got killed or maimed and no one from the staff apologized or did anything. They did send out a medic for the cut I had in my hand  and acted like it was my fault. I was just sitting there when it happened. Service was bad and you can hear the staff talking about you in Spanish. I would not recommend staying here.',\n 'I enjoyed my entire stay at this property.  It is located just a couple blocks away from everything we wanted to see.  I highly recommend room number 1.  It is 2 level room with plenty of hot water.  The front desk service was fast and courteous.  The breakfast is what you can expect from this type of hotel, and I have no complaints about it.  I will make this property my base every time I visit Antigua. If I have one complaint, it is the mattress.  Please upgrade your mattress quality, and I can rate this property higher.',\n \"Good hotel, great room, great location. The breakfast wasn't so good thought. the room was very private and clean. The service was good and it was a great way to start our traveling! we recommand on the upper level rooms.\",\n 'I went with my wife to this boutique hotel in Antigua Guatemala, and stay in the luxury suite that has a balcony. All the furniture were new and nice. The hotel has few rooms, so you felt that you are in your private mansion. Very quiet and romantic atmosphere. Walkable distance to major attractions in Antigua. Staff  helpful and friendly. ',\n \"We saw this hotel here and decided to visit to see if it was a place we'd like to stay another weekend. The employee who opened the door wouldn't let me in to check it out. Reservation only, he said. I said I only wanted to see the hotel and get pricing information, he said no and then opened the door so I could see the parking lot, but wouldn't let me enter. This was so insulting and outrageous.  We never will make a reservation now.\",\n \"It's a great hostel in Antigua if you're looking for a relaxed stay in a comfortable hostel in a great location (2 blocks from parque central). They're strict about noise after 9pm so it's not a party hostel. For partying we were able to go to other hostels just fine and come back to this hostel late at night so was perfect! Often had free coffee and water, and the wifi was good. Provided towels and had great showers and beds, as well as a kitchen available. Other guests were travellers too and met some great people. Would highly recommend!\",\n \"Stayed here one night, I must admit it was a random choice the night before leaving Guatemala, but totally fine. We had a private room with a clean shower, but very basic bathroom and signs everywhere reminding us of the different penalties we could experience if we left dirty towels, used both beds if we weren't 3 persons (one queen size and one single bed) - resulting in an additional charge on the bill, well, the list went on. Also, the doors weren't closed even if we locked them, they were easily pushed away and consecutively open.  They offer a 24h open reception with snacks and beverages. \",\n \"Nice and clean. Cheap and cheerful. Good location, close to centre, but on a quiet street. Hot showers pretty good.   The only downside is the rooms aren't very soundproof, you can hear people/cleaners on rooftop terrace moving furniture around.   \",\n \"This place isn't great, the staff is pretty rude and there are 100 rules unnecessary posted everywhere. The terrace closes early so you can't hang out anywhere. We wanted to switch the night we stayed to do the volcano with a friend and she said no then asked the next day if we were doing it that day (obviously it was too late). Also strick rule about only being allowed to use the bathroom in your dorm which is tiny and awkward if you have to use the washroom as a female. \",\n 'Overall good hotel. All staff were super cordial and attentive. We got a room with a window on a main street so sleeping on a Friday night was challenging. We requested to be moved to a different room and the experience was way better. Nice hotel',\n \"The hotel is beautiful, clean and well maintained, and the staff is good.  Our room was beautiful, airy and spacious, with an ingenious separation of toilet, shower and sink that worked well.  Gorgeous flowering plants are everywhere and well maintained, and the pool is sparking and warm.  There is coffee, tea and water available.  Wi-fi is a strong signal. The ONLY downside is the bar next door.  We didn't have trouble sleeping, but you need to be able to sleep through a heavy bass beat and bar noise that lasts from 7 pm until 1 am.  We accepted this as the trade-off for the excellent location.  You are a well-lit half block from the central square, so safe for going to restaurants and shops at night.\",\n \"Casa del Parque was just OK...the rooms had a musty smell because there is no proper ventilation in the bathroom (which was small).  The room was spacious but hot with only one fan in the room (a lot of the hotels don't have air conditioning). It's a great location but can be pretty loud because it's close to bars, but that can be a good thing if you plan to consume a lot of alcohol...you won't have far to walk.   Overall, Antigua is a great city and when I return I'll definitely stay at another hotel that's a little more upscale and offers breakfast and has a larger pool. \",\n 'Great location, lovely and courteous staff! We stayed in room #2 which had a nice view of the church across the street, a little drafty but nice decor. The place was over all very quiet, probably because we stayed during low season. A bit expensive considering all the accommodation options in Antigua though!',\n 'I have stayed at Palacio Chico several times with mission team groups. It gets us an evening where we can tour the markets, and is very close to several places to eat. They are very accomodating to let us double or triple up. The facility is clean, quiet, and the staff always helpful.   Las Torches across the street is a good restaurant, with easy walking to Palacio Chico. Pricey wine, but the food is fairly priced for the area.',\n 'This hotel was centrally located to great restaurants, central park. The room we had #6 was fabulous! Beautiful decor, nice touches, etc. the staff was helpful and courteous.The patio/garden was lovely w/parakeets that kept you company while you had a simple breakfast that was included w/ the room. I will most definitely go back! Rach',\n 'The hotel is near to the central park. It has a great service and the employees always are attentive. The price is ok according to the quality. I recommend to travel to Antigua, Guatemala and to this hotel.',\n 'We (couple, 40 & 50 years old) stayed at Posada Don Valentino for one night in November 2013 and paid about $40 a night.  Our room was small but clean.  The bathroom was also small but clean; the water was hot.  There was a room safe and cable television.  The hotel is quiet and has a kitchen and salon.  It is about four blocks from Parque Central and one block from the market.  We stayed in four Antigua hotels over five nights and this was the best one for the price.',\n \"This place is run-down, dirty in places, and it's apparent that the ownership lacks the incentive to invest in new things to update an old property.  In our first room, both the TV and shower were broken.  They brought in old sets until one barely worked.    The worst part is that we requested the wake-up call for a morning shuttle to the airport 3 times, because they seemed arrogant and confused.  They didn't wake-us up!  This is the first time this has ever happened to me.  When I told the front office person, she told me to write complaint forms and it wasn't her fault because it was in a book that she showed me.  She did seem upset, but this is a process that should work within any hotel.    On a minor note, the rooms are over-priced for what you get by Antigua standards. \",\n 'Great location right near la Merced church which was the centre for many of the Easter festivities over semana Santa which was just amazing. Small and intimate hotel, made friends easily with the other guests. The staff were very helpful, overall enjoyed my stay. ',\n \"I stayed 1 night on my way back to Guatemala City, the room was comfortable and clean and I was lucky enough to have a room with a view of the rooftops.  There are only 9 rooms or so and it looks like most of them don't have any natural light as they look onto an internal courtyard and stairwell.  The lone guy working on reception was very good, despite his lack of English he was really helpful.\",\n 'We just stayed in Posada San Vincente for 1 night on our way between Guatemala City and Lago Atitlan. We arrived pretty late but they were great. Got us checked in quickly. Room was basic, but clean and had everything we needed. Quiet too! In the morning we spent some time on the rooftop patio, which is gorgeous. Would be a great place to chill in the daytime. Free coffee, tea and water available, and good internet access.   They also arranged our airport pickup from Guatemala City - everything went smoothly.',\n 'The hotel is pretty, very centrally located,  and the roof terrace was nice for reading.  Staff seemed fine and we were able to store our bags after checking out.   Room was big - we had a single and double bed - and free reliable wifi.  However,  our shower was terrible and flooded our room. Our room was close to what I think was a staff room, and staff were very loud during the day and early in the morning. Also, there were quite a few children playing outside our room throughout our stay.   It was fine,  but we stayed in nicer and cheaper hotels in Antigua.  ',\n 'Close to the central square in the old town, nice garden area on the ground floor and a roof top patio area where you can relax. We were able to leave our big bags here as we moved around on excursions. Kitchen available for shared use.

But the location (close to the central parc) and the lovely courtyard makes up for it.',\n \"Great front staff-helpful for setting up excursions/transportation.   Front staff spoke Engliish during the day.  The door was locked at night and you had to knock to get in.  Room clean.  Clean water for drinking and filling water bottles.  Perfect location.  No AC but didn't need.  Great views on balcony.  There is a rooster close by, so can be a little noisy.\",\n \"Stayed here with a group of 10 for one night before heading out to the airport in Guatemala City. The price was great and the staff was friendly and helpful but it's definitely a no-frills kind of place. The shower in one of our rooms was broken, but quickly repaired, though water pressure was still pretty awful. We were on the first floor and it was very noisy at night; not sure if it was staff, fellow guests or street noise. Staff helped us arrange very affordable airport transportation and the free WiFi was pretty strong for Guatemala. It's a good, safe place for a quick stay for those on a budget, but for ~$15 more per night per person, there are much nicer options in Antigua.\",\n 'Room was small.  Bathroom small.  Sparce.  Reasonably clean.  Rock hard mattresses and pillows.  Some of the staff remarkably reserved, almost surly.  Others very friendly.  (These people see a lot of difficult foreigners and could easily get jaded.)  We came to Antigua from a week in a rental house at Atitlan.  The return to one small hotel room could bias my perception of it.  It was not anything special for the price we paid.  We had reserved ahead of time because I had my wife and two youngest daughters and did not want to be looking for a place with them in tow.  I am sure we could have secured a much better price if we had negotiated it upon arrival.',\n \"Staff is very friendly and helpful. Wifi works well.  My friends first floor room intensly smelled like moth balls. Since there is only a small window facing the interior patio, the smell cannot be eliminated. Yikes. I stayed on the 2nd Floor and the smell was not so detectable.  Any noise echoes in the interior of the hotel, so be aware. It's like that in most colonial hotels. I found it a bad value for the money $35/night. No coffee or food available. There are better alternatives in Antigua for less money, like the Juma Ocag, a lovely place.\",\n 'Clean, spacious rooms. Friendly staff. Just two blocks form the plaza (center of town). Although there is no noise isolation, it is rather quite at night, which means a night good sleep. Kitchenette available.',\n 'I stayed at a few hostels in Antigua and this is fine the main issue of noise from the courtyard. 3 people talking sounds like a party in the room! The breakfast is okay just a bit slow. The wifi could be improved as well',\n 'The hostel staff are great and are always willing to help with requests, booking tours and shuttles etc. I would strongly recommend that you book the Acatenango hike through the hostel as it is proved to be professionally done. There is free water and coffee 24/7 and a nice few communal areas as well as a fully functioning kitchen and bar. The rooms are large and have plenty of storage space and the beds all have an individual light and are comfortable.',\n \"We had a pleasant stay here because of the following: Very comfortable beds and good night's sleep. Attractive communal areas including a pretty garden. Good breakfast included that you can enjoy every morning in said garden. Generally happy and pleasant staff. Good security measures with the front entrance having a friendly young lad on the door evenings/early mornings. Erm... Guess that's it... Quite a few good things though, eh?\",\n 'This is a basic clean hostel with shared bathrooms. Our room was a basic room which was clean and comfortable.There was a reasonable breakfast and a nice garden to eat breakfast. The location was very good and it had  good wifi. There is good night security. Shop around for travel deals and laundry as they are slightly more expensive than other places nearby.',\n \"on first look Jacaranda doesnt look like much as the rooms are quite basic. but the place is really clean - there were always cleaners around- and the price is great especially when you consider that a freshly made breakfast is included. its also got very good security throughout the night which is important in Antigua. the showers take a while to heat up but if you persevere you can get hot water! its good for couples or people travelling not looking to socialise, although if you're looking for a hostel vibe i wouldn't recommend it.\",\n 'I was a bit late in organising accom for my arrival in Guatemala so was going in blind. However, I have no regrets.  Lucy on front desk is great with perfect English. The hostel is clean and basic and seems to attract a very chilled vibe as opposed to other more party hostels.  Breakfast is great also.',\n 'I stayed a couple of nights in this hostel at the beginning of my trip in Guatemala, and decided to stop there again before leaving the country. It is a quiet place and the staff was always very nice and helpful. I had a small single room (maybe the illumination can be improved) and the shared bathroom was clean and comfortable. In the morning you can choose among a few types of breakfast, which was good. There is a nice garden in the back of the hostel.',\n 'Lovely courtyard where you can relax have a drink and sit in the sun. Rooms fairly basic but nice enough. Hot water nice views from rooftop. Pretty decor resembling some spanish heritage. Rooms large. Only annoying thing is that you have to knock or rung the bell whenever you want to get into the hotel which means we were woken up late and early as you can hear it in your room.pick a room on a higher floor on the other side of the courtyard ',\n 'I stayed here recently for a few nights. The location is good, just four blocks away from the main plaza. The courtyard area and rooftop are nice and the rooms were spacious and clean. You need to leave the shower running for a good five minutes before it starts to warm up though! The breakfasts were nice and reasonably priced. Staff were also friendly but didn’t understand much English. WiFi worked quite well. Overall decent enough hotel.',\n 'Quiet hotel, with very nice accomodation! People is very knid and always willing to satisfy the client. Breakfast on the roof is very good, with an excellent view on the city and mountains! However, bad smell in the bathroom (but which can be easily fixed)',\n 'This place looks not much from the outside, but when you enter it has a beautiful centre courtyard.  All the rooms come off the centre, it can be noisy if there are people in the courtyard as the noise travels upwards.  If you have room backing onto the road, this can too be noisy with local traffic on the cobbled roads.  Breakfast is on the roof with a great view to volcanoes, which you can see them puffing smoke.  Close location to the centre of town, with good restaurants also close by.',\n 'This hotel is located an easy 10 minute walk from the city center which makes it a nice quiet place from traffic. The view from the roof of the hotel where you have breakfast is fantastic. You can choose from a menu which free breakfast you would like. I ordered pancakes one morning that came with 2 pancakes, 3 different fruit slices, yogurt and granola, it was fantastic!  The staff are very pleasant and helpful, most also speak excellent English especially the desk staff.  I agree with other reviewers regarding hearing everything in your room so if guests are holding conversations at 3 in the morning as they are leaving you can hear everything. You would think that the guests themselves would understand the need to be quiet when they are in the courtyard at night.',\n \"Stayed here to attend a friend's wedding in a chapel in town. This is a charming hotel, walking distance from everything, great breakfast, quiet and has a great rooftop view while you eat. The staff was very nice and attentive and Antigua is simply beautiful.\",\n 'i recently lead a group of 13 to Antigua and Panajachel. the tour company booked us into this hotel. it was very convenient - 2 blocks from Plaza Central w/ several restaurants and small cafes nearby. the interior of the hotel is like an antique store - all sorts of older chairs, telephones, furniture, typewriters here and there. rooms ranged from small [one queen bed w/ two armoires and desk] to spacious [two queen beds, etc]. wifi was available at no charge - good signal. Luis and staff were excellent - friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. no breakfasts but two small cafes nearby.  if you can deal w/ an older place but great staff, San Sebastian is a great choice.',\n 'The grounds are spectacular. I loved the energy of the property. Overall the staff was quite accommodating. Make sure that when you are booking a room that you specify which room type you are requesting. The food was very good. I wish there were more choices for gluten free. ',\n 'Tiny and old rooms (we booked a double room). Almost no light, just like a cave. However the room was clean. The bed was not good so it was difficult to rest properly. On the other side the bathroom was good comparing to the room itself.  No breakfast included and there is no restaurant in the hostal. Anyway there is a kitchen for the guests.  Location was good, few steps from the Parque Central. We booked private shuttle from the airport. They charge an additional fee of Q50 per every hour your flight is delayed. They warn about that when you book the shuttle and it is supposed to pay the additional hour of parking in the airport. Once we took the shuttle we didnt see the driver paying anything and passing any parking barrier, so I wonder if those 50Q are really a fraud. Just',\n \"First things first: the dorms have no supporting furniture whatsoever, just the tiny locker... there is no space for nothing, all is crammed... we are talking about twelve persons and all their personal belongings. A mess.   The bathroom is cleaned once a day, not enough, again, when we are talking about 12 persons using it... when I arrived, just before cleaning, the rubbish bin was full - not a nice thing to see or smell - and on top of that there was no toilette paper (fortunately I noticed that in advance).  Common space is limited to a sterile rooftop with three tables and two sunbeds. Kitchen is also in the rooftop. Now imagine... it's raining or windy and cold... no place to be except in the awfully crowded and messy dorm. And access to the  kitchen will be for the braves\",\n 'We spent a weekend in Antigua, and this hotel was very good.  I have stayed in Antigua several times before and this is the closest I have stayed to the central plaza, and is very convenient if you are traveling alone is safe to walk at any time to the plaza and then come back.  The staff was outstanding, so kind and helpful and the hotel had a nice pool and good rooms.  I liked it a lot.  The price was also very reasonable.',\n 'I stayed here in May with a group volunteering with Safe Passage. I was very happy with my second floor room (#7) and even though there is a loud bar next door I was able to muffle the noise with the room fan and my white noise machine. The room was cleaned promptly and well each day and staff were polite, even when - due to a reservation glitch - we needed to be moved out of the hotel a day early. Staff helped me move my luggage to a sister property down the street. Breakfast was good also.',\n \"If you want to spend some time like if you were at some relative's home, to feel yourself welcome and well attended in a cozy ambiance, this is the place. My family and I have spent some quality moments there, and we have nothing to regret. The owners will treat you like you would treat an old friend. You can enjoy the silence of the country if you want to rest and if you want to go to a bar or a restaurant and socialize with others, within a few minutes you can get to Antigua. Hope to get back soon.\",\n \"After a few nights' stay at El Hostal earlier in our trip, we were really happy we decided to try Posada Don Valentino for our 2nd stage in Antigua. There's a lot more happening at this end of town, more places to eat, it's close to the parque central (central park). Plus the posada is very quiet, offering an excellent night's stay. The staff were very friendly and polite.   The only two minor issues were with the water (somewhat difficult to regulate the shower temperature, although we had the same issue at most of the places we stayed, but for this slightly pricier place, we expected a bit better) and the two rooms we got were rather dark (however, this seems to be typical in Antigua and indeed throughout Guatemala).  Note that a pool is advertised but it's in another property\",\n \"I have made the Don Valentino my home in Antigua on 3 occasions, one was for a week, Other stops were for 2 days. Many positives: English speaking staff, all lovely ladies. The location is the best: Out the door, turn right, for a large grocery, just doors away. Another block to the big market.    A short walk the other way to an ATM, the Central Park, and a place we love for morning coffee, The Bagel Barn, a big gringo gathering spot because of good wifi. A block from the Park is Mono Loco, another gringo favorite because you can watch any sporting event. If it's televised anywhere they have it.   Across the street from the Don Valentino is one of my favorite restaurants, La Pena de Sol Latino. Great food, reasonable prices. The owner is an ex pat from Nashville.      The hotel\",\n \"We didn't stay here but stopped here a couple of times -- first, for directions, and second, because the staff were so helpful and friendly and we used the internet service, and had tea and coffee.  It looks like a sweet place to stay, with clean and handsome interiors and a beautiful, flower-filled interior courtyard.  The staff we met were very kind and attentive.\",\n '\"See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don\\'t know how to \\'hold\\' the reservation and that\\'s really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.\" Seinfeld  I have lived in Guatemala for three years and have enjoyed many trips to different hotels, hostels and resorts during my time here.  All have been pleasant or at least adventurous.  In fact...I need to write reviews for all of my positive stays.  This hotel made me sad.  They hotel took my request for a room.  I confirmed.  Three days later I received an email saying they were sorry but they had given my room to a larger group.  Interesting.  I guess I expected something more then an excuse from them but in the end that is what I got.  I was never offered a real apology just',\n 'The friendly lady at the reception ensures that the guests are comfortable: from breakfast till organizing tours and farewell. The patio is a rustic place to relax and the rooms have a comfortable, romantic atmosphere.',\n 'The hotel is very inexpensive and our room was very clean.  The courtyard was very beautiful and was perfect for coffee in the morning.  The location is very good since it is close to the city center. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.   It is perfect for a quick weekend trip, but I would not recommend for extended stays.  There is nothing special about the rooms and all.',\n 'I totally enjoyed my stay at Posada Dona Luisa. Reasonable rates, clean nice rooms good view of the volcano...Couple blocks from the main square.The hotel is safe and has locked doors at all times.  The shower needs a facelift for sure. The staff was friendly and helpful in every way...I would recommend coming here if you want to save money and be able to walk into town to enjoy beautiful Antigua.',\n 'For a lot of old hippies, to get a clean shower, a decent bed, and get off the street would have been paradise.  Cramped quarters, clean, sheets and fresh coffee, INSTANT in a land known for his roasting and grinding..it´s good for those seeking adventure.  A bummer you have to pay $7.50 USD a night to park your car 3 blocks away. It is less than 4 blocks to the big center of town where the Indian venders come to see you everything, including cell phones they stole from someone the day before.',\n 'We had a great stay here and at 3 other hotels under the same chain (long story). At each place, we negotiated a rate of 25 a night which didnt include breakfadt but gave us access to good clean kitchens, wifi (except on hotel) and very lovely staff. These hotels are easy places to stay for a good price. Get involved!',\n 'Very typical Posada, great location, conveniently close to everything, very friendly staff, good service, clean basic rooms... My recommendation is to avoid Room # 1 by all means, it is literally right by the reception area (3 steps), and so can be extremely noisy! Other than that, I would recommend!',\n \"Their customer service is really really bad. Unfriendly and seemingly uninterested to make their customers happy. The beautiful yard is sprayed with pesticides which stinks for hours (even smelled it the next day...)  They made a mistake with our booking and skipped a day (so they wanted us to leave for one night and return the next day). We wanted our money back instead as we didn't want to move every day. but for over 1 hour they refused to do so. The owner lives in the US and apparently failed to give any staff member the power to 'change the policies re 3 day cancellation period' or the memo that making their customers happy will make them return. We will not.\",\n \"This place has horrendous customer service, old mattress that you can feel all of the springs in, it is super loud and the workers wake you up first thing in the morning as their chatter echoes through the whole hotel. And don't think you can book in and cancel later because you hate  it because they will still charge you the FULL price to cancel your room. There are so many wonderful places to stay in Antigua, this place isn't worth your time or money.\",\n 'Nice place close to central park. We just walked in and asked for a room they gave to us for 280q. For somthing equal to this normaly would be 400q. Id say average size rooms with hot water.pillows a bit hard. The plants and decor was nice and dont forget to lounge in the sun on the roof and take a photo with the volcano in the background.we found cheaper hotelsfor 200q but they were not nice., more like a hostal and one said hot water when i looked in shower there was a sign saying to ask for hot water and they leave a bucket outside your door lol. ',\n 'Good location, everything Else average! The rooms are basic and the hotel is cute But nothing Fancy. Service wise We had the best and the worst, the people working there are polite and helpful But We didnt like that they charge you extra for paying with crédit cards! And CAREFUL with doing your laundry here !!! They ruined some of clothes! They stained them blue despite the fact that We separated the clothes! ',\n 'My stay at three monkeys was okay, but I would not stay here again. On a positive note it’s in an excellent location, very close to many restaurants and bars, the people staying and working there were great, and the onsite bar was cheap! So if you love to party it’s a good place to stay.  However the beds are uncomfortable and have bed bugs, the showers only have hot water at a pressure so low it’s like a sad trickle of a bucket, and the tours booked through the hostel were sub-par. The hostel tours consistently ran 30mins - 1 hour late and crammed so many people onto a bus it was like a chicken bus for tourists. There are heaps of tour companies around Antigua so I would recommend shopping around.',\n 'A cool little hostel in a good location. Aesthetically ticks the box, cute garden area, hammocks, cool lighting. Felt trendy and definitely frequented by the ‘younger’ traveller / gap years etc Basic bedrooms, reasonably comfortable, a little loud at night but couldn’t complain for the price. It did the job for a one night stop gap and the staff we did meet were really friendly. ',\n 'We loved the hostel! We felt very comfy since the moment we got there. We (2 females) slept in a shared room of 4 (2 bunk beds) with private bathroom, it was spacious. It could be a bit cleaner though, especially the bathroom.

Breakfast was nice and included. Staff is helpful with shuttleservices. Located near the main avenue',\n 'I had a great time in Casa Jacaranda! The garden is an amazing place to just sit read a book and relax! One of the best thing about this place was the included breakfast and the kitchen they have for the guests! The bathroom were always clean and the bedroom too.   One bad thing is that they dont have outlets at the dorms but you can charge your stuff at the kitchen or somewhere else.  The staff was always willing to help with a smile and kindness! ',\n \"When I arrived here the hostel felt a bit weird, because of the man that showed me the place did everything very quick and didn't really explain. It was very dark everywhere and annoying western music. But then I saw the garden in the back, the clean and comfortable bathroom and my private room was nice as well, so at the end it was good. Not a really social place and a bit outside the centre, but in front of la Merced you can eat really good food at night and it's safe to walk there alone!\",\n \"Quiet south side of town, around the corner from deluxe hotels, just a few blocks to Parque Central. Sunny rooms along tiled walkways surround lush garden with plashing fountain (muted at night). Great deal! I stayed 16 days, each morning checking out the weather & taking in views of Vulcán de Agua and puffing Volcán de Fuego from the rooftop terrace. Complimentary coffee & drinking water. Optional breakfast was decent, served alfresco & only a little more than you'd pay in a typical cafe. Abundant in-room storage.\",\n 'The staff at this hotel are extremely pleasant and courteous.  They do speak enough English to communicate.   The rooftop terrace is excellent for viewing the volcano and nearby hills over the town.  The grounds are well kept with nice flowers and landscaping.   We enjoyed the walk to parqué central just 4 blocks away.  We will not stay here again due to a small number of mosquitos in the room and the head-ache-inducing odour of insecticides on about half of the property.  We were pleased however that our room was changed to a less smelly insecticide room.  Finally,  they told us they would accept Quetzals or US cash.  We tried to pay with $100 US.  Staff said they could not do so because they did not have enough change in Quetzals or USD$.  Rate was 7.5 to 1 if they had.  Later',\n \"This hotel would be so nice, if it weren't so noisy.

There is also a lovely roof top terrace from where you can enjoy the views of the lava on the active volcano nearby Antigua.\",\n \"Pros: Beautiful courtyard, nice rooftop for breakfast, and clean well decorated rooms with A/C. 5-10 minute walk from centre of town. Cons: The front door to the building is always locked so you have to press the buzzer and wait for the staff to let you in every time you enter the hotel. At least they are there to open the door 24/7. Can't comment on price because went here as part of a tour package.\",\n 'The hotel itself is beautiful as the courtyard is covered in beautiful plants.

I was shocked by the facility considering it had the lowest price. The is hostel very clean and beds are comfortable. Showers are super hot.

Enjoy a view of volcano Fuego and one of the historic churches right rom your bed. The staff are friendly and helpful. We loved our stay.  Cons - Although the overall location is quiet, the walls are thin and we were awakened by a screaming 2 year old each morning. The shower had an extremely slow drain and held about a foot of water at our feet. Regardless of the above, we would still stay here again.',\n 'Our room was really nice, I especially liked the shower.  Plenty of hot water with great water pressure. The WiFi was AWESOME!

There is a choice of 3 large breakfast plates (Guatemalan, American, and I believe the third was pancakes) but you do have to pay for it and it is worth the money. There is always coffee, tea, and water available for free by the pool which is a nice touch.  The only thing that kept them from getting 5 stars is the bed was very uncomfortable. It was lumpy and hard. I was so tired by',\n 'Very basic lodging but conveniently located, close to restaurants and the churches. Good view of the volcanoes from the upstairs terrace. Friendly staff that spoke some English. They were really good at providing information and replying to emails before we arrived. They also arranged our transfer from Guatemala City, which was nice. Because it was during Semana Santa, the room was seriously overpriced (2-3 times). Some noise at night, coming from an outside establishment. The kitchen is more like a little open shack. There was no breakfast offered. We were able to use the pool at the sister property of Casa del Parque for a fee. WiFi was included but slow. It was an OK place for a short stay and the staff was nice.',\n \"We went to Antigua for a wedding in April 2012 and we stayed in Posada Doña Luisa.  We got to the hotel very late (11:45pm).

We were able to warm up the kids milk and feed them some cereal we had with us which save us some money on breakfast outside.  The staff was very nice and didn't give us any problems to check out.

A pleasant girl showed me to the room. I asked if I had any worries about noise from the street but was told this should not be much of an issue. This is the only place I've ever stayed and had a nightmare without even sleeping. Next door is a bar/club which, on the first night was banging until 3 am and then the noise from the street including shouting, car alarms, blaring horns and screeching tyres did not abate until 4am.

On the other hand, since there are a bunch of young people drinking, there are some inconsiderate behaviors ie leaving the kitchen mess, coming back into the room and waking people up, etc. It can be quite loud, especially the dorm rooms by the kitchen/bathroom. The rooftop over the courtyard is a great quiet place to get away for a bit; there are nice views, too.

We were on the top (2nd) floor and it really heated up in the day because the cement roof was above us with little glass blocks that allowed light in. No AC so it was hard to sleep at night. The place was very clean which is great. Friendly helpful staff. Beds were lumpy and not the most comfortable.

It looks fantastic, but it can get quite loud as the seating arrangements outside the hotel rooms encourage dwellers to sit outside, but the noise wasn't particularly jarring. It's also very centrally located: just a couple of blocks from the central square (and always a ten minute walk to wherever may be recommended in terms of food, bars, or sights). There's also a rooftop area with seating arrangements and a beautiful view of the volcano and Antigua in general.  The staff was great, in particular the women at the front desk: very pleasant to deal with and they went above and beyond their role to help with our queries and ensure we got to Guatemala\",\n 'We stayed here for one night after night hiking volcano Tajamulco, which meant we needed sleep.

Try the canillitas de leche, they are delicious!',\n \"The hostel was clean and the reception was nice. However, although the breakfast was free, it was awful. Also, they advertise on hostel world and other websites that there is a restaurant and bar which is not true! Other than breakfast, you can not order any other food or snacks.. There also is not a bar at all, with the exception of ONE small fridge with a few beers in it. We found the hostel to be a little too quiet. We were travelling as a couple, but also looking to meet a lot of people.

The three reception staff members, Wendy, Carmen and Karen, could not have been more accommodating or responsive.  Rooms are cozy and clean, if a tad small.

It was nice that they provided two bottles of water.  The wifi was strong and fast.',\n 'We went on a very busy time in Antigua, Easter (Semana Santa) and the small town was crowded.  But we were happy with this accommodation, which included all three meals. The hotel is simple, but very clean.  They served meals (on this ocassion) in the terrace overlooking the volcano.  It was lovely.  The staff was kind, but no so helpful with respect to tours and directions.  They may need to improve that.  Location was great, a few blocks from Main Plaza.',\n 'This hotel was very sweet with a lovely courtyard to which all the rooms opened out to. This was a very clean hotel and the staff were very welcoming. Hot water takes a while and can cut in and out... but that is the only bad experience.

BUT the hotel has gated parking, is conveniently located and within walking distance of everything, has an amazing breakfast with a view on the roof and most importantly, a hot shower. Maybe it's because it had been a week of cold showers in other cities but I damn near cried when I got to take a hot shower and look at a volcano while I drank my coffee. \",\n 'We stayed two nights and had a Spa-Suite. The room was great with a privat roof terrace. The jacuzzi was dated and we didn‘t use it. There are a lot of events in the venue and people come and go. Restaurant was good, prices reasonable.',\n \"We stayed at this hotel the first two nights and the last two nights in the country.  If you don't have high expectations you will be delighted at this quaint hotel.  The 3rd story is a great view of the volcanoes.  Rooms are small but clean and mattresses pretty good.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Tip: if you stay here they do not have screens in the windows; no problem though there are not a lot of bugs.  You will have a light curtain to keep this curtain closed bring a safety pin or a barrette will do in a pinch. We spent the last two nights there because we knew what to expect, no surprises\",\n 'My friend and I were hosted wonderfully at this small hotel in the center of Antigua.

Great place, would stay there again if we end up in Antigua   \",\n 'My wife and I checked in yesterday. We took a private room which was 200Q a night for two nights and paid for the nights in advanced. An hour or so later we overheard the receptionist telling another guest that the hostel is fully booked. Since we were considering a third night we asked the receptionist if it also applies to the private rooms she said no, there are free private rooms.  But this is where things got weird: According to the receptionist the price of the third night will be 312Q more than a 150% increase!

Free coffee only on weekends.',\n 'The plàce is very much ok and not in best shape. No breakfast and still 37.50USD? Even with brekky its way too much for Antigua.

When arriving at the hotel the first impression was that it was rundown in a rundown part of town.  However, this impression soon changed once inside the building.

Have stayed there also several times by myself and always felt  safe. Would recommend it to anyone heading to Antigua.',\n 'We arrived tired and hungry, so when the fourteen of us went to our rooms with a huge group of noisy, drinking German tourists, we were not impressed.  I made these reservations 6 months ago and had requested that we all be on the same floor.  Long story short, the hotel management did an EXCELLENT job of changing our room and all went smoothly.

It is located at the end of a street, at the edge of the city center, making the back and forth from the center not so enjoyable (polution from cars and busses and uneaven pavement). Breakfast is poor. Very noisy from cars and other guests. Internet signal is good, but only near reception. Shower is OK but water gets cold and super hot while you shower.  Luxurius or mid-range category is overstated. For $100 they charge you can get much better hotels max 2 blocks from the central square. They all have the charming colonial style. I will not stay at this hotel again and do not recommend it, but staff were super kind and attentive.',\n \"Didn't like the dorms here at all. 3 bunk beds squeezed into a 2.5x3meter shoe box. Thank goodness we were the only ones in the dorm otherwise you would not even be able to open the door without knocking the other people in the room. The safe boxes in the dorms only fit passports and otter small gadgets. I did not like the bathrooms either - they smelled stuffy and stale and i actually chose to not shower when we stayed there. The communal kitchen was barely useable. Breakfast i must say was the highlight of our very short stay there. My fruit salad with yoghurt and muesli was fresh, so no complaints there.\",\n 'Stayed here for a few nights as it was a top pick for Antigua in Lonely Planet.  It was fine but not really amazing in any respect.  Positives: - Really helpful staff who speak good English - Good security - Lovely breakfast - Good range of tours available through the hostel, and prices which are quite good  Improvements: - Since the Lonely Planet review they seemed to have added extra dorm beds to the already-small dorms.  Ours had six, crammed into a very small space. - Some of the toilets/showers are in outside cubicles.  In some respects this is nice, but it means there can be a few more mosquitoes lurking about.',\n 'Clean hostel with beautiful gardens.

The booking was recorded as one person and not two, although the room booked was correct with twin beds.  However, they insisted on charging another $10 on arrival as the booking was incorrect on their system. Why one person would request twin beds, I don't know.

Making the best of our change in plans, staff helped me organize a trip to Pacaya, leaving at 6am the next morning. We were surprised upon checking in to see the quality of the room, considering we were paying 250 q which in this price range has been giving us modest but nice accommodation in our travels in Guatemala . As another reviewer just pointed out, the hostel does not have a proper ceiling. There is no separation between the rooms, just a tin roof covering the tops of the rooms.

(There was at least one other person staying in a dorm but I didn't see him until morning).   However (and the irony is not lost on me) late that evening (well after 12) at least two other people arrived.

Firstly, its a great great location...very safe. Very nice staff at the reception and server at breakfast. Beautiful courtyard too and  excellent strong wifi throughout hotel. the problems are these though: very noisy in courtyard even after 10pm rule..hot water takes ages to kick in, small ants in the bathroom (otherwise very clean hotel i have found)...lousy coffee for breakfast which is a shame as this country is known for its coffee.

At first we loved the place as it is beautiful and the people staying were really nice. But after a while we started to notice and heard many stories about the owner/manager screwing people over with their rent amount, charging extra for no reason and being really mean to people to basically scare them out of the house. This had never effected us personally until near the end of our stay. We had a night out where we came home and made a tiny bit of noise (which is quite normal for people in the house as a lot of people worked at bars), for some reason she just decided to go crazy at the group of us which consisted of yelling at us for days, telling us we couldn't sit in the kitchen, shooing us out\",\n \"If you're thinking after reading Lonely Planet that this sounds like a cute place to stay, you're going to be massively disappointed. This hotel is as soulless and corporate as they come in Guatemala, and is absurdly overpriced for what you get. Worst of all, it's impossible to enjoy your stay because of the insane amount of noise.  The rooms are very small, beds rock hard and linens ancient. The lighting feels like you're in a prison cell. The shower is absolutely pathetic. The only way to get hot water is to have the water flow at the bare minimum. Every other hotel I stayed at in Guatemala (and all of which were CHEAPER than this dump) had legitimate hot water.   But most egregiously, this is hands down the loudest hotel I've ever stayed in.

I always prearranged my airport transfer upon arrival to a country I visit for convenience and safety. The reception employees at day time were very helpful and they spoke English well.

When I originally stayed there it was being run by the owners - 3 sisters and they lived there with a menagerie of dogs, birds (loud parrots - screaming out Se Fue la nina!!!! every few seconds it seemed) & they & their families all lived there.  Although it was anything but peaceful in those days the hotel has always seemed to have a lot of charm & it was cheerful & lively with all the hustle bustle of the families living there.

It's a comfortable and cozy kind of place, hidden from the street. Our room was a budget one, nicely decorated and along the main corridor. It was a bit noisy at night with guests coming and going, so if you stay ask for a room around the courtyard or the great little apartment up on the roof. There is a kitchen here as well as a comfortable lounge room.

The first half was fantastic - the room was below the roof terrace, it was peaceful besides the external street noise and the racket from a neighbouring restaurant at the weekend and the WiFi worked perfectly. The second half was a smaller much darker room with not so good WiFi & you could hear everything in the adjoining room. Breakfast is okayish.

The couple in the room next door kept their door open which made it seem like they were in our room.

The hotel is a small house, which is part of the bigger Porta Hotel, so you get access to a lot of their services like breakfast buffet, pool, spa, etc. The nice thing about the hotel is that it is very private (I think only 10 rooms), so it's definitely very quiet, so you get to relax. The rooms are clean and nicely designed. The hotel could use a little bit of work in some areas, but nothing major. It is also very conveniently located and never a far walk from all the cool spots. The only reason I don't give the hotel 5 stars is because I think the staff could have been more welcoming and friendlier.\",\n \"We had a good stay at the Casa Encantada, which we got to from hotel Porta Antigua (they had no rooms available and suggested their sister hotel). We were promised to have access to all of Porta Antigua facilities - including the buffet breakfast.

Old furniture not taken care of, the bed sheets very old, ugly decoration and overall not very clean. The worst service ever!! The reservation said it had capacity for 6 people, but there were enough beds for 4 people only. Supposedly there was a pull out couch, but it was a normal couch, that by the way smelled like sweat.

Hot water in the showers. The other accommodation options seemed a bit dark and claustrophobic.  Unfortunately, the evening we arrived, my travelling companion was hit by a motorcycle and had to spend a few days in hospital. He insisted on returning to the Hostal Antigua when he was discharged.

The kitchen is well equipped and very clean with a lovely roof trace next to it....a great place to chill on the sun loungers in the afternoon heat.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  They also give free drinking water, tea and coffee.  Lovely little getaway.',\n 'An okay place to stay in fairly expensive Antigua.  No frills but in safe area close to centre of town.  friendly owner. very small room with no outside window, only window opening with no glass to interior hallway.  much more of a hostel than a hotel.',\n \"Four of my friends and I stayed at the San Sebastian our first and last nights in Guatemala.  The location is great -- about 2 blocks from the main square, and just around the corner from Dona Luisa's bakery, a terrific bakery and restaurant.  The owner Luis was very helpful and we even had use of the kitchen.  Each room was like a museum, with ornate furniture and decorations.  The rooftop terrace gave us 360 degree views of Antigua.  This isn't a luxury hotel, it is wonderful and funky and we felt safe and comfortable here.\",\n 'So pretty place. Fantastic furniture, enviroment. Our room was wide, with a private bathroom. Big jacuzzi, hot water (rare in Guatemala). The best memory i bring with my self is the polite and kindness of Luis, the owner.

And the price is not bad!',\n 'This posada is an amazing two blocks from the Parque Central--making it a short walk to everything. The miracle is that at night, you cannot hear traffic or street noise.  THe décor is funky--lots of old art, crucifixes, sculptures and paintings all over. The beds are comfortable enough and there is plenty of hot water. They do not serve breakfast but within a block in any direction there are many breakfast options.  Luis--who I think is the owner--is a warm and welcoming man. He truly tries to make guests feel at home here. I could imagine becoming true friends with him, if there was more time, as I think many guests do.  I stayed here for a couple of days on two separate occasions in March.

The whole place was thoroughly cleaned and inspected every day.',\n 'The hotel has a green, welcoming yard but the rooms are dark and the whole place is pretty noisy, due to the thin windows (you can NOT actually close them entirely) and the owner s family who wakes up at 5:30 AM every morning. Also, avoid the rooms by the laundry at any price (VERY noisy). And don\\'t let the hotel get you a cab from the Airport : their service is 12$ more expensive than the airport \"safe\" cabs. Still it´s a clean, convenient place to stay.',\n 'We really enjoyed our stay here.  The location is fantastic for the price.  The roof top has a beautiful view of the volcanoes and sunset.  The rooms are basic, but good for the location.  The staff mainly speaks spanish, so not as helpful as I would have liked when recommending a restaurant.  My only major complaint is the shuttle company that they arranged our transportation through from Antigua to Pana.  The driver was pretty rude and he dropped us off far from the public pier and lead us into the hands of \"helpful\" boat drivers, who took us and our luggage to a private dock and attempted to have us pay 20-30 dollars for a ride to santa cruz, instead of 2.50.  We figured this out and lugged our bags to the public dock.  It was a very uncomfortable and unpleasant situation. ',\n \"We stayed here with our two young children.

The atmosphere and decor were spot on. Our favorite part was the cakes and coffees served each night. The only issue was the hot chocolate that was served at night. The hotel was full but there was only one pitcher which ran out quickly! My children requested it at breakfast one day, but were told they wouldn't have any until the evening! It was delicious and we just wish there was more!! The rooms were a nice size and the lounge areas around the hotel were plentiful and relaxing. It was nice watching the lava coming from the volcano at night from the roof top deck! \",\n \"I stayed 2 nights at the Hotel San Jorge. Like all of Antigua, it looks like a fortress from the outside, but the door opens to a lovely garden and fountain-a welcomed respite from the cobblestones and pollution of the city.  The complementary breakfast is fresh and more than adequate to get you on your way. The garden is a nice spot to read or catch some sun. The safe was not working in the first room I was assigned to, so I was switched to another, which was roomy and adequate. My only complaint was no hot water on the 3rd morning of my stay. When I inquired about this, I was told  they were aware of it and were waiting for the repair man, but I was gone before knowing when and if he arrived.

The room was a little on the small side for two people but was OK for the price and had a decent en suite. The complimentary purified water was a nice touch and the staff were pretty good.

What we enjoyed most was the breakfast area up on the roof.  Delicious fresh fruit juices and jams and a variety of things to choose from for breakfast.  The views of the volcanos and the flowers in the garden down below are priceless!  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The pool is very small and with the cool temperatures in Antigua, we never really felt like jumping in.  The internet was very good, fast enough to stream movies.  The worst part was the noise from the street at night.  I didn't pack ear plugs but I wish I had.\",\n \"This was a great place to call home for a few days. The only things I would note are: the front rooms are noisy all night because its on a main street that trucks and buses go through quite often; there is only one person working most of the time, so don't expect a huge staff. Otherwise, comfortable room, bathroom and shower, nice living area and beautiful views.\",\n \"This hostal was clean, had friendly staff and the free purified water had a nice touch to the atmosphere. However, the 4-bed Dorm that I stayed in was extremely small, which meant that whenever someone woke up early to use the bathroom, he or she would wake everyone else up. If I were to go back, I'd opt for the single (although the price skyrockets from a $7 for a 4-Bed Dorm to $37 to a Single) or try to get a cheaper single in an another hostal.\",\n 'great place for the price. quiet, clean, good working facilities, and a nice little roofdeck with a decent view of the surrounding volcanoes.  we found it to be in walking distance of the main city square and most of the city, with lots of nice restaurants/bars around that area in general.

Would recommend for those on a bit of a budget, who can stand a couple of rough edges, but value a nice bit of homeliness while away.',\n \"Irma was very helpful and accommodating. Our group had a couple of special requests that she was happy to help us with. She made a wonderful breakfast each day and we had a great time practicing our spanish with a patient teacher. The hotel was clean, quiet, comfortable and near to everything we wanted to check out. As we didn't find many reviews on Booking.com we double checked on TripAdvisor and saw that it was well reviewed and we now believe those reviews were well earned. As long term lodgers we needed a bit of space to dry our clothes, especially after a wet and chilly trip up Acatenango. There wasn't a line yet but Irma assured us she was aware and was making space for one in the near future.

I recommend this place to everyone.',\n 'The staff at Hotel San Jorge are very accommodating, caring and responsive.  It is very easy to talk to the owner about other arrangements (transportation, laundry--which is quite cheap, even mail).  There is free mineral water for the guests.

I don't know how this happens but the staff of hotels in Antigua, after staying in just three, so far are the best I have ever seen.

It had a nice bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub that didn't work. If you get a good deal this place will work out for you.\",\n \"I booked this hotel on the basis of good reviews on Trip Advisor and must admit I was a little disappointed. On the whole it was fine- they were friendly on reception, it felt safe, it had internet, there was a TV in our room... but the 'rustic', 'Guatemalan' aspects of the hotel basically added up to a bathroom with an old pink suite that had seen better days and we were quite cold at night with the one blanket provided.\",\n 'I am a 60+ woman and was a solo traveler in Antigua last week.

I was very happy here!',\n 'My wife and I stayed at this place on 2 separate occasions and thought the place was great. We stayed in the junior suite, which opened up on to a terrace with a great view of the volcano and the room was very spacious. Irma is a fantastic host and the breakfast she cooks is amazing. Only negative is that the power points in the room do not work but there are lots of outlets in the common areas which compensate for that.  I would highly recommend this place.

This is not how to deal with a delay in a flight. A hotel owner with computer and a phone can determine when a flight is delayed for three hours. A really bad ending to a difficult flight. I had no proof of what he paid, nor did I agree to pay 3x the already expensive cab fare in advance. And of course he wanted cash. Then the second 'night', if we can call the first one a night, we had trouble sleeping because the owner was outside our window, in the lobby, with loud voices. We nicely asked him to hold it down, which didn't work. All in all, less than stellar experience, to put it nicely.\",\n \"Myself and two chicas stayed here on New Years eve.  It was a lovely room, big and spacious with 3 queen beds.  The room had lots of character and room for luggage etc.  The lobby area had lots of antiques and artifacts to look at.

That said, I saw good bones up on the higher floors and they were hauling in new mattresses while I stayed.  So much of the hotel seemed unfinished.  Outside my room was a large empty area that had potential for so much more.  I saw this also on the third floor and on the mini roof area.

The staff were extremely friendly & helpful.  The breakfast is a real positive, included in the price & you have a choice of five different menus.  I took the last remaining bed in the Casa & that happened to be a dorm bed. I don't usually opt for dorm stays as I prefer a bit of privacy.  That said, the beds were very comfortable, although the one draw back is that the dorm is too small for the three bunks in the room, as the remaining floor space does not allow for room to unpack, repack or organise your bag.

It sounded like they were in my room.  Another thing that is annoying is that they have no breakfast or coffee for you.. Nada.. They do have a very good internet Cafe that serves coffee after 8:00 AM or so.  Another weird thing.. once you put your stuff in the hotel safe, you cannot get it out after 8 PM for any reason.

The only thing that they should improve is the service. We were planning to stay for 3 nights, 2 in a dorm and 1 in a private room. The  night that we got there, the receptionist tell us that they have rooms and we can just pay right away, but we didn't pay because we didn't have quetzales.    Next morning we were planning to go in a trip but I stop first  in the front desk to tell her about ours things were ready to move to the next room.   She just say: Well I do not know is somebody told you but we don't have a private room for you. What?!

I had the same room as AngieinFL.  It's just not a good room to be stuck with.  I was surprised by the electric showerhead, and it didn't do the job.  I was also really annoyed to be charged for a call even when it didn't go through.  The women at the front desk and the night watchman were very nice, and helpful.\",\n \"We were here a night, and the room was on OK size, the sheets were clean, the room was clean, and the staff was very friendly, so overall, it wasn't a bad stay.  However, our only window opened to an interior hallway, so it was pretty stuffy and dark.  Also, the shower temperature was pretty much uncontrollable the first day and just stuck on cold the second day.  And last, the first floor is very loud.  Every time people come in after dark, they ring the doorbell and talk to the night desk man, and when your only window is on that corridor, it is very disruptive.   So, my recommendation, if you decide to stay here, is to request a second story room, bring ear plugs, and hope you get a good day for hot water.

Unfortunately, there isn't a single comfortable chair in the rooms by which to enjoy the fire.  The duvet on the bed was so heavy that we opted for the space heater instead.  The bathrooms are adequate, but so dark that even Frida couldn't have plucked her unibrow.

There's no doubt the hotel is beautiful and calm and staff are very nice and attentive.  A few things to consider when booking this hotel:  - it's 4-5km to Antigua city centre: one can easily take a bus during the day (for Q3) but at night you'd have to take a taxi which will cost $5-7 per person! There's no courtesy taxi anymore as someone said in previous comments. I wouldn't advise you to walk there at night either...  - breakfast isn't great considering what you pay for the room: you get concentrated orange juice, coffee and a plate consisting of some scrambled eggs, frijoles, slice of papaya and watermelon. Pretty basic for £70 a night in Guatemala!  - if you're planning a visit to one of the volcanos or a\",\n 'It\\'s not often that you travel to a hotel and leave thinking you\\'re actually gonna miss the place and the people, but it happens here.

They don\\'t offer lunch and dinner regularly, but we were informed this is one of the services that will be provided sometime this year, I hope I can go back to test it! If you can stay here, and don\\'t mind the short ride to Antigua (actually less than the 5 minutes they tell you it takes), then this is a jewel that will soon be discovered by many.',\n \"I literally had the worst wax in my life here. It was so painful and incomplete. I still have a ton of hair all over my body regardless of the woman that was hacking away forever. And I mean hacking. There was no process, it was just a free for all, using the same dirty strip for entirely way too long which left me with a ton of wax all over. The walk home was so uncomfortable because the wax was rubbing all across my legs and cheeks.  She also didn't hold the skin down enough so the strip kept pulling my skin up which hurt a lot and was inefficient. The wax was obviously of super cheap quality. She didn't ask what shape I wanted for my brazilian, and she asked twice to see if it was okay shape, and it literally looked like a child drew a shape, it had no form, no clean lines\",\n \"The hostel is very clean and quiet however it is overpriced for a private room.

We stayed in one of the rooms in the back so we didn't hear any noise from the street. The hotel is very central but it's very calm.   Staff was super helpful and nice! Always trying to find a fast solution for the few questions we had.   The only negative thing was the air in the room. It was very moisty. If you are sensitive to this I would not recommend.

It is a clean place with the amenities you'd expect.   Our only disappointment so far has been in the price.  The website lists a private room with bathroom for $27/night if you use their website (3rd party) reservation system and then about $3 less if you do it in person.  I did mine in person and was not only charged the $27/night but also a 10% surcharge because I used my credit card instead of cash.  I recommend that you reserve on the website where you can pay with your card and avoid the extra 10% fee they attach here.    The staff is excellent.

As far as location goes, Antigua isn't so giant that anywhere you stay is super far away, so pretty good base for walking around the city and planning day trips. The staff is awesome- they take part in socializing and are super helpful in arranging transportation.  The cleanliness is very good in the private rooms, but in the dorms could be a bit better.

The accomodations were very basic, but they were clean.  Irma and her family were very happy to help with information about tours and give other information about Antigua.

Though I have stayed for less in similar accommodation in other towns (Panajachel, San Marcos) I think that Antigua might be slightly more expensive in general.  The location is good, the rooms and shared bathrooms clean and best of all, Irma and her son (the husband wasn't usually there) are super friendly and helpful.

There is a parking lot like 2 blocks away, but they are gonna charge you some extra bucks (like Q100) if you leave your car all night there.   I think they don't use TripAdvisor, I sent them a special request after the reservation and got no response at all. So you better call them if you need something.   In the good side, hotel is really near to central park and lots of fun places to go. We really liked it, and is very likely that we go back some day. \",\n \"I stayed with my friends in a 3 bed dorm. The room itself was nice and, although the mattress on my bed was quite worn off and uncomfortable, everything looked pretty new and clean. However, there are no lockers (there are HUGE wardroves in the room, but nothing that can be locked) and the toilet was a real MESS: the shower floor was covered in a layer of around 7 centimetres of grey dirty water, which was really gross. Also the floor was all covered in back water and the sink was full of hair. The trash bin was full too. When we tried to have a shower, we realised there was not hot water and when I first opened the tap, the handle got separated and I found myself with it on my hand not knowing what to do! Moreover, staff doesn't do ANYTHING about messy guests. There was a\",\n \"I was a bit disappointed by this place. I was expecting to be able to do yoga as that's what I read but there was no classes and I'm not quite sure what made it a wellness place. There was no breakfast included and only water you could help yourself to and this wasn't always topped up. The bed was super comfortable and it's quiet so you can get good night sleep. The bathroom wasn't cleaned daily though and the bin was always overflowing. \",\n \"It's quiet, not too many people stay here so it's quiet. I stayed in the dorm, 6 beds, there were no privacy curtains on the top bunks. No lockers to lock your stuff in. There are closets where you can store your luggage and bags, they're in the room, no locks. The restroom had overflowing trash in the trash can, in our room and in the restroom downstairs, I wish they would empty it more often. Breakfast: toast, milk, coffee, fruits... there's free drinking water but tea and coffee you have to pay for (coffee is free during breakfast hours). There's one common room inside, it's a room with one sofa and 1-2 chairs. You can also hang out and talk in the patios, views are nice. The bed felt comfortable, the sheets looked clean and tidy. Shower took a while to get warm water.\",\n \"We stayed here for a few nights. The price for a room includes a good breakfast (several menu options).  (Double room is about 170 quetzal). The place is clean, as are the shared bathrooms. The wifi works pretty good here. It's a good quiet choice in Antigua, if you're not looking for a partyhostel. \",\n 'You can do a lot worse in Antigua for the price. We paid 180Q a day for a private room with a shared bath. This is generally quiet, always clean, with a helpful staff. Breakfast is included in the cost of your room. They do have a bit of a mosquito problem so bring some DEET. Recommended for budget travelers.',\n 'We booked a private room so that our stuff would be secure.   Returned to the room to find it unlocked. We overheard two other couples complaining of the same thing.   Another day, the cleaners had left our door and windows open but had departed to work elsewhere. I mentioned this to reception and they promised to secure our room. When I returned some time later, the room was as the cleaners had left it - windows wide open, door open and with all our things (and their master set of keys!) visible.   When I tried to bring up the hostel\\'s poor security attitude with the man at reception he just smiled and said \"ok\". Not the least bit concerned or apologetic.   The rest of the hostel is dark and dingy. Our room was extremely noisy starting from about 5am.   Avoid this place.

Cuando regresamos el que nos atendió en la mañana no estaba, en lugar de él había un joven que nos dejó entrar pero sin el derecho del parqueo, teníamos que dejar nuestro carro en una fila extensa de carros, era de seguro que al día siguiente nadie podía salir. para no dejar el carro afuera lo dejamos en el corredor haciendole entender al señor que no nos despertaran en la mañana para moverlo, la responsabilidad del desorden era de ellos.

I can't remember the last time someone looked down their nose at me like, it was quite a trip! Arrogant, condescending, and macho beyond belief.  And because they gave me a 'deal' on the room (overpriced, noisy and cave-like with tepid water) they informed me, a little too late, that I would have to leave an hour earlier. Simply appalling service and attitude, in a usually friendly and servicial Antigua.\",\n 'After staying in Antigua many times we decided to,try this.  The place has the bones of a 5 star but everything else was sub par.  if you know Antigua, you know there are fresh flowers everywhere.  A beautiful bouquet is about 10$ US.  We stayed 10 days.  When we arrived there were a dozen dead red roses on the main coffee table in the public area  and they stayed there for a further three days.  They were never replaced.  Where candles are everywhere in Antigua there was never even one lit.  The sheets are of poor quality and have holes in them.  Same with the towels.  Some had more holes than towel.  The magazines in baskets were from 2002-2007, nothing newer.  There were spiderwebs all over the books in the bookcases.  It was like Miss Havisham in Great Expectations.

However, as I canceled 40 hrs before hand instead of 48 hrs, they refuse to refund all the money, even though they know about the hurricane. I was able to get permission to take my vacation in November instead, but they still refuse the refund.  It is ungenerous of them and gives insight into their way of doing business.

You better go early to sleep cause as soon the staff arrives you won't be able to rest peacefully, wich is around 7 am.

Although the prices were a bit more expensive than other locations in Antigua, we decided to splurge on this hotel (which was twice as much as other hotels) for our last few nights in Guatemala so that we could be a bit pampered.  Much to our chagrin, this hotel was entirely not worth the money.  For one, there was not consistent hot water.  Several times, the electricity shut down in the middle of a shower, leaving the person showering in the dark and with cold water.  I ended up carrying my flashlight to the bathroom just in case!

Our bus ran late due to traffic and border delays and we told the owner of the hotel that we would not be arriving until late, perhaps midnight. The owner immediately responded and said he could not receive us at that time and the latest guests are allowed to arrive is 8 PM. This is stated nowhere on the booking page for his hotel - if it is, it should be the owners obligation to inform guests of this policy as no hotel I’ve ever stayed at before has enforced such a ridiculous rule. We had reserved a week long stay here and he outright canceled the entire thing.

Being that we stayed through New Year's Eve, we expected most hotels to be slightly more expensive than on other nights.  However, this hotel was not only more expensive than another hotel we stayed at in Antigua a few days earlier (literally twice the cost), but they required a two night minimum and the room was of far poorer quality than the first hotel.    Here are a few details of our stay: -Our quad 'deluxe' room (a higher price than the regular quad which we selected because of availability) did not have any outside-facing windows and was poorly lit. -The glass on the windows that faced the hallway were broken, allowing for anyone to reach in and open the window\",\n \"After staying at so many nice hotels in Guatemala, we had a reservation at Posada Don Valentino. The room was dirty with a g-string and other junk under the bed. The room only had a window to the hallway which was facing directly to the internet cafe and was therefore very noisy.

She goes out of her way to makes her guests feel valued and special. The home has a beautiful patio. The rooms,  while basic, are spotless. The breakfasts and dinners are typical Guatemalan cooking. The prices very reasonable. Located about 2 blocks from huge Mercado and about 7 blocks from central park,  the location is very convenient.

My room had two beds, a dresser and a window out on to the internal courtyard. Maria was very pleasant and patient with my poor Spanish. The meals, which were $5 extra, were very good. Breakfast was more than enough to allow me to skip lunch. All in all, and excellent place to stay if you're on a tight budget.\",\n 'Super nice lady running the hotel. Very clean and quaint.

The bathroom was completely outdated and the tiles were moldy on some parts. Not what you expect out of a 5 star hotel. I’ve stayed at other 5 star hotels in Antigua Guatemala and had better experiences there so far.

They refused helping us. After arming a scene they got the manager who finally agreed to help. The next day when we checked out they charged us a commission of 16%. In all my travels worldwide I have never felt treated that badly..... Although location of this hotel is unique. The mentality/service we faced after being robbed was absolutely horrible. Last but not least they serve you water in plastic bottles, taking into account their country has serious garbage recycling issues',\n \"I stayed at Luna Maya for 3 nights over Christmas. Definitely more expensive than most hostels in Antigua but nice.  Not the place if you want a social scene.  Dorm beds were really comfortable and if you have a bottom bunk it’s like have a pod with a curtain, light and even a shelf. Top bunks have steps not scary ladders. Easy to get a good night's sleep.  Nice bathroom and no one else ever seemed around, so not busy even though just one per dorm room. Limited social space or maybe just no one knows to use it or doesn't feel like they can use it.

There was a yoga studio in the building but I didn’t see any schedule for taking part which might have been good to get guests involved. They did let me use the room for my own practice which was nice. I also noticed there was a room set up for massage but again no details on prices or booking.

The hotel website provides information about both hotels.    We arranged airport pick up through San Pedro II and stayed there 3 nights in Dec. 2019.

There is a rooftop patio with nice views of the surrounding volcanoes.  Good shower.  Did not include breakfast but there are good places to eat close by.  Can arrange shuttles to and from the airport. Wifi is spotty. They let you know in advance that they do not accept credit cards.  No problem with that.  However, when you pay in soles, they calculate the bill using 8 quetzales per dollar instead of the going rate of 7.5.  Not a big difference, but slightly irritating,',\n 'Excelente ubicación y muy bien antendida.

Guatemalan antiques and artisan furniture fill the common areas (every inch) and the rooms.  Not a large courtyard to roam about like some of the Antigua hotels have .. small & charming.  We had room almost in the lobby ... ask for upstairs room.  Our room was perhaps configured as a second thought .. not real walls ... the wall that separated us from the lobby was made of window panels w/ curtains or shutters for privacy .. which then meant little light. It also was next to the kitchen so a bit noisy.   It was a beautiful room, though. The staff was super nice and helpful .. courteous.  You will love your stay here and feel as if you have escaped the hotelesque places.  Perfect location.',\n 'We stayed for four nights and enjoyed the perfectly appointed room. Breakfast next door at the Porta Hotel was included and was something we looked forward to after our morning walks. We also appreciated the use of the sauna since we arrived on a cold, rainy day!

The rooms were a little dark but well furnished with an excellent powerful shower.  The beds were small, we had a triple room but there were two very small doubles.  The breakfast was really very good as was dinner although the bar was over priced with little atmosphere.   We found information a little scarce so did not know about the other part of the hotel.  The chocolate and candle factories were no more than a small shop and the museums were a bit lacking but overall it is a nice place just a little impersonal.

Most of the college students were between the ages of 25-35 (graduate students).  We had fun, and nearly took over the hostel since there were so many of us.  The service was great and the staff very friendly.  It was clean and always neat.  I felt safe and secure there and there were no security problems.  But the walls are \"paper-thin\" and you could hear someone flushing the toilet or taking a shower even if your room was down the hall.  Additionally, the \"hot water\" was nearly non-existent  as the electric fixtures preparing hot water really did not work.  Don\\'t touch them, you will get a shock!

That said, you can almost have their little lounge to yourself when you want. The rooms are tastefully done with Guatemalan textile and clean. The bed was comfortable as well. The only issue I had was the lack of ventilation.

Since our three nights occurred over a period of 10 days while we volunteered and visited in other cities, they allowed us to store extra luggage between our stays.

After we agreed that the price includes breakfast the following morning we get to breakfast and received two plain pieces of toast and fruit while theother tables received also eggs and plantines.

You can't tell from the outside, but this small hotel has a beautiful courtyard with blooming plants, greenery and a pool. There is also a covered breakfast area that became our gathering place in the morning mostly because they had free coffee and cold water. Fortunately, our room was upstairs above the breakfast area.

I had requested an upstairs room, with a balcony, and that is what we got, with a view of the volcano. The room was very clean.  However, it is way overpriced for what you get- tiny, although quaint and rather charming rooms. The big drawback was the noise. It is next door to a venue with five bars in it, and very loud music reverberates through the walls from Thursday - Saturday night, until 1am. There was no way we were going to be able to sleep through that! To their credit, the management rang the bar and asked them to turn it down, which they did, but it was still terribly loud.

Two blocks close to the Arch, a few blocks close to Central Park and best a bunch of restaurants. Breakfast was delicious. Overall, I had a good stay. One suggestion.... Leave a night light at the entrance. My flight was at 6am so I had to leave at 4am. I was in room #18. I had to use the flashlight on my phone to find my way to the front.',\n 'I recently stayed at the Villa Colonial Hotel during a work conference. This colonial style hotel is very well taken care of.

It's at a walkable distance from the central park (about 9 blocks). Food is good, coffee is great, most of the staff is friendly, however the front desk people were a bit cold and will not make eye contact. The bathroom design is not very smart, there is a step after you open the door and the light switch is beyond the step, so you can easily trip on it in the dark. The shower has a partial wall and that's it, so water gets all over the floor making it very slippery. The pool is pretty and a good size, with warmish water.

The less good things: I got about 90 seconds of hot water for 2 out of 3 showers. There was neither a/c nor a fan.  Merely irritating things: the front door is locked, so every time you come back to the hotel, you have to knock and hope someone heard you.

If you closed the shutters however, the room was very dark. Maybe the rooms upstairs are better. The bed sheets were old and looked worn and they did not fit the double mattresses. Also the pillows were pretty horrendous. The towels were a bit threadbare. On the plus side, the shower was good with very hot water and the room was clean.

Like others have said in the reviews, the rooms are super clean, the bathrooms are nice, they have flat screen tv's in every room and it truly is a cute little hotel.  What is exceptional is how nice, kind, and super friendly the owner and his son are.  Thats what makes this review a little difficult for me.  I so want to love this hotel and support this hotel and the owners but there are 2 things that you will likely struggle with if you stay here.  1. Its kinda noisey.  Yes, they have parking inside....literally inside.

Dinner at the restaurant was very good. Most of the staff were also lovely and very friendly and helpful. Relaxed vibe.  The negative stuff - mainly hinged around our reception experiences to be honest. We arrived at 830pm, one guy on reception and a large wedding party taking place so probably a bit stressed. However, he wasn't very welcoming, was quite dismissive and just wanted to get me to sign various paperwork, give us the key and send us on our way.

The customer service is impecable and breakfast was very good.  As far as the negatives, parking was a nightmare, since they do not have own parking and we were sent to a sketchy place. The parking attendant seemed confused as to which hotel we were coming from, and he did not tell us that other cars would be blocking our exit. It ended up working out well. Also, bathrooms are very small, as there is no place to put down your toiletries bag.

Hotel is lovely, rooms are comfortable with modern bathrooms. It's slightly further away from the centre of town, so while this is ok during the day, it may make some people feel slightly unsafe walking there late at night, as the streets are not well lit. We had no problems though. Breakfast here was fantastic - freshly made to order and huge servings. The only thing we would say is that the service isn't fantastic. Since it is a small hotel, quite a lot of the time there is only one staff member available, and sometimes this person did not speak English. We had a few times where we had some questions and couldn't really get assistance from the hotel. But we still enjoyed our stay here, as this didn't bother us too much.\",\n \"The room has a view on the main street of Antigua.

The breakfast is served every morning on a roof terrasse that is beautifully decorated and where you can also hang out throughout the day to read or browse internet. The woman serving breakfast is super nice and the breakfast are delicious: there is a choice of main meal and there is a food display of: coffee or tea, fresh water, bread, cereals, fresh fruits and cheese. Fresh orange juice was also part of the breakfast.  Only negatives: I think you pay more just because the location is on the main street. Also there is\",\n 'Nice hotel in central location.  As a word of warning despite what is advertised on their website, trip advisor and booking.com this venue does NOT have a 24 hour reception.

To their credit the hotel management team did go the extra mile to help try and recover the bag the next day.',\n 'We stayed for 3 nights. Room was clean and we had enough space.

We showed up to the hotel and the receptionist lady turned us away. She told us she didn't have a room available. But she said she had a small room, a very small room. She would have to put in an extra bed and it would be tight. She told us to look for other accommodations.  We asked her to cancel our reservation and to not charge our card and she said she would cancel it. We stayed the night at another hotel, but our card still got charged.

Plus there is an amazing Gelato place next door.   I stayed in room 9 on the 2nd floor, away from the Lava Club. It is way too loud. I had to wear earplugs and download a white noise app on my phone. I do have insomnia so this is part of the problem. The other issue is there seems to be very thin walls between my room and the room next to mine, so I became intimately acquainted with the people in the room next to mine, and could hear them using the bathroom at all hours of the night.

The location is excellent, two blocks away from the Central Park and the rooftop view is beautiful. Breakfast was provided each morning which was good. Being from Canada, it was a little bit pricey because of the exchange but they have no control over that. Don’t forget to include the 22% tax on the posted rate which we forgot about. However, our room had no curtain in the bathroom so we were unable to leave the window open while we were showering which resulted in the room being very humid and steamy. Additionally the roll up blind in the bedroom was broken which reduced the amount of fresh air coming into the room. These are easy fixes which hopefully they will take care of upon reading this review. Would I stay here',\n 'Stayed here for 3 nights. I am aware of very high ratings of this hotel. I agree with some points mentioned, it was very clean, very good service as they booked my transportation very fast and efficient. However room #9 was very small, no where to put my stuff, no closet. Fast internet. But very small TV with no english channels. No refrigerator in the room, and no safe, so I had to visit the city taking the passport and money with me. Privacy was also in question. Either I had to shut down the windows with no light, or anyone passing by would see what I was doing in the room. ',\n 'The bed was comfortable but was a bit short.

As soon as we mentioned our hotel name to the driver, the  couple in front told us that they had booked that hotel 3 days prior using booking.com and this was not honored. We thought that this was just one bad incident. Wrong!  The manager just refused to look at the booking.com printout and told us no room. This is normally not a problem but this was New Year's Eve and we knew that hotels tend to be full at this time.

The other problem was the breakfast: everything was absolutely disgusting except the coffee which was merely poor.

We had a junior suite on the second floor (9). It is clean and has a fantastic view of Volcan de Fuego. The room was great apart from a soft bed.   Breakfast was ok, and parking is not on site but 2.5 blocks away wasn't so inconvenient. You can walk to the central square in 10-15 min. It was shaping up to be a nice deal for Antigua at $105 per night. We would have overlooked the fact that there was no hot water on the first day and constant clanging of bells from the nearby church from 5:30 am if that had been the only complaint.   Unfortunately, the second night, there was a loud bar playing music\",\n 'We had a large room for a family of four. The room is nicely decorated, though the bathroom is kind of small.

The staff was attentive and friendly. Our 18 month old enjoyed playing in the garden. We appreciated breakfast included in the daily price and the hotel was in walking distance to the central park. For the price compared to other places, we were satisfied with our stay. However, we had to close our windows because of the mosquitos and our room got pretty stuffy. Maybe they could have a few portable fans available. I have also stayed in places that have better showers. It was a sufficient short-term place to stay.

I stayed with a friend traveling to Antigua we were very happy on arrival. The next day we woke up to being covered in bed bugs. Which is not a way to spend your vacation. It was horrible. The hotel asked for proof which we had provided. They did launder our clothes and change our rooms which was appreciated.

It started with the fact that they didn't have our reservation and they wanted to send us to another hotel. I complaied abiout it and mentioned that just one day before I exchanged e-mails with the owned to re-confirm the transfer from the airport to the hotel (took from them) so they knew I was coming. How can they say they don't have my reservation? In the end they gave us a room just to discover a dirty, noisy place having nothing in commune with the photo's on the web site.

The architecture and decor were beautiful, as was the flower and greenery- filled courtyard and pool area.  Our room was clean, nicely decorated, and very comfortable.  We were travelling without children so didn't mind the proximity of our room to a nearby very busy nightclub; I would suggest contacting the hotel prior to making a reservation to assure that if you seek quiet on the weekends that you are in a different area of the hotel.  On the flip side, we appreciated the proximity of this hotel to the vast offerings of restaurants, clubs and pubs.  And it is only a few doors down from the beautiful central Park.

When we arrived we had to ask to have the sheets changed due to being dirty, and throughout our stay we also noticed that the mugs had old lipstick on, and towels were dirty, and so were the pillowcases. It was the first time I considered using my sleeping bag inner to sleep in the bed during my entire stay in Guatemala. The staff offered no solution to the problems.

This time, I tried the Santa Teresita. I pre-booked a Single Room online at a 68% discount. This brought the price down from US$33 / night to US$10.50 (or GTQ121 including the additional 22% taxes). This came with a free breakfast. The room was small but came with an ensuite with daily housekeeping, a hot shower and cable TV. A Breakfast is worth about GTQ25 ... so the room was excellent value at GTQ121 but IT IS NOT worth the Rack Rate of GTQ380 / night that it is listed for. It is worth about GTQ175 / night including Breakfast. The hosts were nice people and it had a comfy common area. It is, probably, a little too much 'on the edge of town centre' for some people ... it was a decent\",\n \"My booking included breakfast but one of the young male staff member attempted to charge me.  He told me only two breakfasts were included and the others with eggs were not included.  I agreed to pay for the non included breakfast because I wanted the eggs.  When we were checking out, I told the woman I need to pay for breakfast and she corrected me saying the breakfast for me was included.  This is how I caught the previous man in a lie.  Otherwise I liked the hotel.  I paid top dollar since it was peak time.  They do not accept visa, only cash.  Well I'm not sure I believe that now since that man lied about the breakfast.\",\n \"It's a basic hotel, the staff were nice and friendly. The location is ok, slightly on the fringe of the centre and at night, the street lights are not so bright in the area.

Otherwise, it's ok if you're looking for a cheap and clean place to stay in Antigua.\",\n \"I stayed here for two nights and thought it was a good budget hotel.  There is a kitchen you can use and the rooms are very clean.  The owners and staff were always available and very helpful.  It's on a busy road, but the rooms are tucked away in back so noise was not a problem.  It is not fancy, but I think it's perfect for the budget traveler:  quiet, clean, decent location at a great price with friendly owners.\",\n 'We booked one night in Antigua so wanted it to be special. Visiting during Holy Week we wanted to be sure to see the procession over the flower petal murals. Casa Buena Vista was perfect as the procession went right past the front of the hotel!  The location is perfect for exploring the city as well. It’s a great place from which to launch a walking circuit of all the sites in the city and is very close to a square where a (cooked) food market bustles at night. Plenty of tiendas for essentials like wine and snacks too.   As for the property, it is just lovely. Pass through a locked gate to a gorgeous small colonial courtyard with a small fountain. There is also a rooftop where we sipped wine before dinner.   We were in room 3 and my suggestion would be to avoid rooms 1 thru 3.',\n 'I made a Booking.com reservation. And they ask to paid in the hotel the night. Then they charge me the night in my credit card. weeks and weeks asking the refund, and only a waste of time.

Rooms are very nice, clean and the bed was really comfy. Rooms had Cable and Fans. The bathroom was pretty cool, tiles are like rocks, feels your are in a waterfall, although is missing a bit of an air outlet.

It has a nice location (not to near to the Santa Catalina Gate but perfect to walk). Staff was extra friendly and ready to help.   It has a nice patio that was lit up at night. Very dreamy.   I would stay here again.',\n \"We stayed here for five nights whilst we were in Guatemala.  It seems that many stay in the South West of Antigua where McDonald's and Subway were located, but I am glad that we stayed in the opposite side of the city, where it was quiet. We walked all over the town - even the main market was about 15 - 17 minutes on foot.  We had to go to the bank in the Central Park a couple of times, but it was within ten minutes.  Breakfast (included) consists of 2 eggs, black beans, fried plantains, and 2 roles (and coffee or juice).  We had to leave early twice, so we had breakfast 3 times at its lovely dining area.  Very satisfying.  When people have dinner in the courtyard, the noise comes right into your room, but normally they leave by 9 PM.  2 bottles of water replenished daily. \",\n 'We had no idea when walking through the thick wooden doors off the cobbled street that we would be entering a beautiful courtyard, a lovely garden in the middle with small table and chairs around the outside.

It is in the heart of Antigua and so very easy to walk around',\n 'The rooms are OK but the majority has a shared bathroom which is shared with many and super small with the toilet in there too. Be careful with the prices they quote online as they will add 22% tourist tax!! It does represent itself as a budget hotel but in my experience the quality is definitely not higher than a hostel.',\n 'My wife and I spent 3 weeks at this apartment hotel and were totally satisfied with our accommodation..  It was very clean and bright and one of the best equipped places we have ever stayed at.  This was a very important feature for us because my wife likes to cook a lot when we are away and normally the lack of good kitchen utensils limits what she can do but this was not the case here.  The location is great being within easy walking distance of the Parque Cenral and the great restaurants in the centre of Antigua.  Lesley and her staff were superb and responded very graciously to every request we made.  We will certainly stay here again on our next trip to beautiful Antigua',\n 'Once we arrived we were greeted at the closed gate by the 24 hour security guard. We were pleasingly surprised when we walked into the condo. We had a small living room, dining room, full kitchen with cooking utensils, washer & dryer and private open air outside sitting area downstairs. Upstairs was the bathroom and bedroom with ample room. Our walk into town discovered a very small grocery store 1 block away for basic needs but a larger grocery store on the other side of the main town courtyard about 6 blocks away.

We did use the car to go sight seeing, off the complex, to the Filadelfia Coffee Plantation.   The only negative feature was the',\n \"The Hotel itself wasn't too bad. It was a cute style with rooms that were decent and clean linen and towels. There was Wifi. The water was lukewarm. The view from the terrace was gorgeous. The location was pretty good but it is more of a quiet place to stay. The biggest issue we had was that they put us in one room for a night because other room were occupied but then they needed to move us the next night because the room we were in was the only one able to fit more beds for a larger group. This was a huge inconvenience and had they planned better it could have been avoided... otherwise pretty cute place!\",\n \"Situated a 10 min walk from the main square.  In a quiet street but with shops and bars not far away (and an amazing bakery). Our room was in a row just after reception, and had a comfortable bed with clean linens.

Overall very good value. \",\n 'Cosy little place down on 2da avenida sur. The staff were so nice and friendly and always offering us tea and coffee! The Wi-Fi was good and it was very safe. You had to be let in by the night guard each night. Good value for money in Antigua. Not a place to stay if looking to meet others, more a quiet place to rest the head.',\n 'This small hotel is well executed, the staff is super helpful and the breakfast on the roof terrace was pleasant. That said, like many hotels in Antigua, you don’t want to open your window to the street (most rooms) as the noise continues well into the night.  Antigua has become one big hotel; I doubt that anyone actually lives there anymore. There are a few hotels on the periphery that have the space to block out the street noise, but unfortunately, this isn;t one of them.

If you want a room to sleep and nothing more, it’s fine. The shared spaces were very nice, with a roof top balcony where we watched the fireworks at New Year which was amazing. The staff were very helpful and kind, although there was a mix up with our online payment that resulted in us taking out quetzales that we later didn’t need. We had a room with a double bed that was pushed against two walls and so was quite cramped, even for a couple. Our window was out onto what appeared to be a storage area for cleaning supplies, which meant we got to hear a lot of morning conversations from the housekeeping staff.  The hallways were pretty loud too. It seemed most rooms had no exterior windows at all so I’m glad we had our one',\n 'This hotel is operated by a group of women very close to the central plaza in Antigua.

The hotel website and pictures are well done Photoshop because the REAL hotel are totally different form reality. I paid ($131.85 US Dollars for 2 night like $922.95 Quetzals) with breakfast included. Room are terrible poor clean and nasty towels really old and almost useless.

The hotel had good and bad points.  * Location: The hotel’s location is ideal--less than one block from Central Park, which the whole town revolves around.   * Staff: Extremely polite, helpful, accommodating, and friendly.  * Architecture: The hotel’s interior space is gorgeous, with a Spanish Colonial style, open-air courtyard and hallways.   * Rooms: The rooms are a little dreary; definitely less spectacular than the public areas.  They could use some fresh paint and less shabby furnishings.  The worst thing about the rooms are the truly awful travel posters dotting the walls.  The posters are cheap and in shoddy frames.  The place would instantly look so much better without',\n 'Euro Maya is a nice, small hotel, with a great location! The staff are friendly and helpful. The room was clean, and the breakfast was fine. Euro Maya has two things going for it: 1. The roof-top terrace. A great spot for breakfast and enjoying the volcano views! 2. It is 3/4 a block from the Central Park.

If you are looking for a clean, friendly, affordable place to lay your head, Euro Maya fits the bill!

THIS IS NOT A 4* HOTEL, its a travel agency that happens to rent some rooms. You could tell from property sign too. The location is superb but that\\'s all. The problem with the disgraceful service began before we even step our foot it the \"hotel\", as they charged my credit card (issued by european bank = got lousy exchange rate) without asking me while I wasnt there !!!!! We arrived before the supposed check in time and when I complained, they talked about some non-existent policy for which Booking.com was mentioning nothing.   The Front Desk employees (or whatever this supposed to be, probably the travel agency) could hardly speak',\n 'We enjoyed our stay at El Hotel Meson de Maria.   Everyone was incredibly professional and courteous,   Breakfast was delicious and a perfect way to start your day  The location was incredible, we walked everywhere.  El Meson de Maria is  at the center of everything!.    This hotel is very clean and  incredibly charming, and decorated just right for Antigua!

Having said that, we highly recommend for anyone to stay at this hotel.',\n \"We were in Antigua for a birthday celebration, we booked this hotel because we thought it was centrally located and the price was ok. The hotel is located in town not very central but accessible. They offer parking but it's 4 blocks away. The bad thing about this hotel is that it's located next to the Alliance française, the weekend that we stayed there they had a concert. We were ok until the bad concert lasted until 1 am. At 1 am I had to ask the watchman to call the police, be aware that at 6:00 pm the manager leaves, they close the door and there is nobody to assist you. Also across the street there is an establishment that I am not sure if it is a bar, restaurant or hotel. They had groups of noisy people coming and going all night long. We didn't sleep, it was horrible.\",\n 'We had casa noble booked as a second option as we needed to extend our stay by one night and our accommodation told us they were full. We saw the reviews on here so went to check the place out. We were pleasantly surprised to see a very pretty hotel set around a lovely garden. We had a look at a couple of rooms and they looked clean and comfortable. The owner was also very friendly and helpful. In the end our hotel had availability and pure lazyness stopped us from moving hotels for one night. I would, however without hesitation stay at this hotel if we were to come back to antigua.',\n 'Stayed one night as our first hotel was full on the last night of the stay. Place is in a sorry state of disrepair and looked very unloved.

Service was not obvious and the place seemed spooky, Luckily just for one night but in good conscience cannot recommend.',\n 'We stumbled onto Hotel Casa Antigua at the last minute, as we were changing our travel plans. It is made from two adjoining, renovated colonial houses with high ceilings, antique touches (including a pulley to open/shut a skylight in room #5), and beautiful gardens/courtyards. The beds were comfortable, and--importantly for our family--there were multiple rooms with options for 3-4 beds. It is two blocks away from the central square and minutes from many great shops and restaurants. Although in general the hotel feels quite secluded from city noise, there were some modest issues due to the configuration of rooms opening to the courtyard. At late afternoon (and briefly in the AM), there is a huge flock of birds roosting and causing a ruckus in some of the trees in the courtyard.',\n \"This is a centrally located hotel for people wanting a decent place to stay at a fair price in Antigua. We had two rooms and they were very different in size so worth asking for a spacious room when booking. The smaller room also smelt  very strongly of cleaning fluid but it did have a window and fan. The staff were warm and friendly. There was free water and tea/coffee on tap which we hadn't found in the more expensive hotels. My private bugbear is hotels charging you for bottled drinking water in small bottles so fair play to Casa Antigua which does not do this. There are lovely places to sit quietly and a shop selling local goods.\",\n 'I would concur with all the positives about this hotel, i.e., cleanliness, convenience of location, breakfast, etc. We did not meet the owner, but rather dealt with a young lady who was new to the area, so the fact that she spoke English, did not help us much in answering local questions. The other receptionist did not speak English. She was on duty when we checked out so I was unable to resolve the $100 overcharge on our bill until I returned home. It was eventually resolved with a series of emails. If it weren’t for this uniquely negative experience, I would return to this hotel and recommend it to others. However, with so many hotels, we decided to choose another when we returned at the end of our vacation. It was not nearly as nice and more expensive.',\n 'I stayed 4 nights at this cute little hotel. It’s located at an amazing spot in the very centre, a minute walk from the park. I stayed in room 15 which has a king size bed and a private balcony with a view on the street and a volcano. The property is well maintained, has a nice pool and inner garden. Good value for money! Next door is El Barrio a traditional complex with 5 different bars. Mind that if you stay in room 15 that you will hear some faint music till around midnight. After that it’s quiet. In the other rooms I guess you are fine. We didn’t mind it, at all, it even gave some charm, guess we are city people :)',\n 'The hotel and the rooms are nice. My wife and I got the Mountain View room and the only thing we didn’t like was the bathroom. It was really small and when flushing toilet the water pressure was super super slow.  Bathroom where toilet is was really small. Need to leave door open while using it.   Really important: if you like to party. There is a super cool bar next door that lots of people visit and socialize.  If you like to sleep early to get energize for your tours, this is not the best place to stay.   Noise ends up around 1:00am   Costumer service was really amazing.  We really enjoy their service from everyone.  ',\n 'This is a lovely hotel right off the main square. Has a pool, which is great. Right next door to a few bars so its nice to have that near if that interests you, but if you have issues with noise, request an interior room. Very nice staff.',\n 'Antigua already has a lot of personality, and this hotel continues that. Helpful staff, rooms with character, great views including volcanos, They were very helpful when my initial room was a challenge as I have a light disability. It was exchanged without fuss. The food was excellent including provision for allergies.',\n 'This hotel has great service, beautiful grounds, clean rooms and comfy beds. Loved the amenities and the location. I loved having filtered water in the room.   The hotel restaurant is lacking in vegetarian options on their menu... surprising given the focus on sustainability. One night I had an asian dish for dinner.',\n 'I stayed with my wife for two nights and it was very quite and comfortable. The price is good and cheap. The owner are very nice and welcoming. The place is clean and they have also a good kitchen. Free wi fi  The bilding is a bit old and not all the rooms are the same but ours was very nice',\n 'We stayed 3 nights. We appreciated the warm welcome of the staff and room was clean and perfectly matching with the description of the website.  Many advantages with this hotel: located in the city center (everything on walk can be done), agencies very closed, quiet, ect.... The hotel itself is very nice decorated and I personally I really enjoyed the terrace with the view on the volcano....really beautiful.   The only inconvenient was that other customer were a little bit behaving loudly during night...

The staff is friendly but unfortunately they don't do anything if you complain about the noise at 11 or 12 o'clock in the evening ... you can hear every noise and movement in the other rooms and outside, we were also unlucky to have clients in the hotel that did not care about other clients that want to sleep. Do not recommend this hotel if you want some peace and quiet.\",\n 'Although out of the central district of town, the property is lovely with a large garden.  Apparently we were lucky to get an interior room opening to the garden as we overheard from others that exterior room fronting the street was noisy. Room was quite large with a cool dome.  No heat or AC: presumably temp is usually moderate (although reading another review, seems they were too hot.  Going in Dec, the weather was chilly and we were on the cold side). Main drawback is the included breakfast is mediocre at best. Otherwise, staff friendly and helpful.  It is a bit of a hike over uneven cobbled road into town but easy to get taxi or tuk-tuk service at reasonable cost.',\n 'First the positives. The hotel looks great and the grounds are a credit to the team responsible. The location with the restaurant overlooking an active volcano was spectacular, imagine dinner with a backdrop of lava spouting from a volcano. Probably not a daily event, but we were lucky. The hotel should however be better, and lets itself down. The rooms are clean, of a good size but lack air con. You would therefore expect to be able to ventilate by opening the windows, but with no insect screens, this is just not sensible, resulting in a stuffy room. The rooms also have no room safes. Guests can place valuables in security boxes at reception, but with travellers carrying tablets, laptops, cameras, phones etc this is not suitable or practical. It is really not good enough not to',\n \"A very pleasant hotel on the outskirts of the colonial city of Antigua. Lovely gardens, friendly staff and a good restaurant.  Our room was clean and a good size. My only complaint would be that the room was very dark even with the lights on.

Four blocks from the park and/or La Iglesia de San Francisco.  We stayed in the big suite w two beds.  We were thrilled to have a modest kitchen and hot water.  Okay, it  wasn't 400-year old adobe, but who cares when you have your own washer/dryer and stove?    Someone pointed out earlier that their slusing door wouldn't lock.  We found this to be true in our unit as well.  I ended up using the dustpan handle as a door lock, which worked alright.  I can understand her concern, as the unlocked door expised to the outside was unsettling.  Would we stay again?  Certainly.  Especially for an extended stay.\",\n 'I recently stayed in this hotel in Antigua, about 7 blocks from Central Park, beautiful, cozy two- story villas with washer, dryer, full kitchen, two beds + comfortable sofa bed.  Parking included right in front of the rooms. Would definitely recommend.',\n 'Lovely position and we had a nice room. Glad I was not on the courtyard though with people having breakfast right outside my bedroom window. What was so sad was the poor attitude of the front desk staff. Water was rationed with no attempt to offer filtered water. There was no tea service in the room. Morning tea was fine but any other was undrinkable as the manager either couldn’t or wouldn’t provide hot water. Maybe it was a lack of English but that is also not good enough for the front desk. By the way they charged for it! No effort made to resolve the problem. Plastic flower petals on towels ! Really! Don’t bother ! No turn down service so dirty towels and cups left all night. Not what I would call a “boutique” hotel. More a very average hotel with a label.',\n 'Do not stay here! We booked through booking.com and paid in cash when we checked out.

STEER CLEAR!! ',\n 'This hostel provides a bed, at an average price.The location is rather decent; it is where you want to be in Antigua. There was rather a problem with the cold at night and quite a strong smell of disinfectant at times, which at least tells me that some cleaning occurs there. It has little in the way of a social atmosphere and certainly lacks any of kind of usefulness or warmth from the staff. They are neither friendly, nor knowledgeable about the town or transport there. More importantly, during my stay, I began to suffer from the Zika Virus. While the hostel was of no fault there, what was concerning to me was that I was in bed for several days, moaning and looking dreadful, while the staff walked past, unconcerned. I would value some social responsibility.',\n \"We have just arrived here after reserving in advance. The rooms are not as shown in pictures. There is no natural light, some don't even have windows.

Terrible rooms and terrible customer service.\",\n 'Stayed three nights. Unfortunately the room is smaller than it appears in pictures, no natural light and very stuffy air. We had to keep the door open. A lot of noise from the staircase. Staff friendly enough but seem a bit over worked. We often had to wait some minutes to be let in at night after ringing the bell.   Place clean enough, decent location, decent shower. Pretty nice upstairs outside courtyard. There are places which offer better value for money elsewhere.',\n 'The receptionist provided us with little to no information as to the details of the hotel. We had to prompt every time. The room was clean but the walls are so thin that you can hear anyone who may be making some noise.  There is no air con or fan so when it is hot, it is very hot!  Breakfast was not included in our rate despite it saying it on our hotel room door and on our confirmation. When asking the staff about it, it wasnt really her problem so meh!  I would probably pay extra and stay elsewhere next time as Antigua is beautiful and deserves a better experience.',\n 'The rooms are a small box with no ventilation, no air circulation and not even a fan.  You get one tiny window with a \"courtyard\" view.  The shower only got to luke-warm, and they turn the water off periodically at night.   I will say that the staff was generally nice and they did their best to make our stay pleasant.  We had an evening flight, and the staff did let us keep our bags at the hotel after checkout.   This is NOT a luxury place.  It is in a decent location so if you just need a place to crash it might be ok for you.  We visited in December, so thankfully it was cold at night, I imagine it would be impossible to sleep if the temperature was hotter.',\n \"We booked at Monasterio because we got a very good deal through Expedia. I was a bit anxious about it since they only had one previous review. Now I'm glad we stayed here. It's very welcoming and the staff is great!

The staff is very friendly and the lady at the front desk speaks fluent English. If you want luxury and spacious rooms - you will want a different hotel.  If you would like a nice, clean, quiet place to sleep ... its fantastic.  Plus you do get breakfast included in the rate. The hotel is a few blocks from the central park however, on the same street as the Santa Clara ruins, close to Hermano Pedro Church and many amenities.  The walk to central park is only 10 minutes maximum.  Which by the size of Antigua is very reasonable.  Many times we have walked around Antigua after dark.  It is a very safe place and there are a lot of police, tourist security and PMT (traffic police)',\n 'The room is very small, not very clean (dusty). The bed was very uncomfortable and there was hardly any hot water in the shower.',\n \"Casa Noble is very pretty and has really cute and spacious rooms. The staff is nice and the hotel is safe and quiet. The downside is that it's about a 10-15 minute walk from the central area...not a big deal during the day, but it's not recommended to do that walk at night. If you plan to have late evenings (after 10), I'd recommend staying a little closer to the central area (but not too close as it can be really loud, even late at night).\",\n 'We   booked    the    hotel   online   with  Expedia.

Upon entering the hotel, there is a beautiful courtyard, and the property looks rather exquiste.  There are also beautiful views of the area volcanoes.  Both of our rooms were on the second floor, and were large.

We spent many hours chilling there. Breakfast was delicious. Three mornings we had eggs, black beans, salsa, and fried plantains accompanied by bread and coffee/tea and one morning pancakes, fruit spread, and fresh fruit.

They eventually gave up but such a horrible experience specially from the overnight guard.',\n \"We stayed here for 4 nights. Our room was basic and clean. Loved saying hi to the dogs on the way in and out. Great location. The kitchen upstairs was pretty basic - didn't end up using, but ask at front desk (we asked for wine opener and they had).\",\n \"Tasty coffee! Very pleasant and helpful staff. They help with the shuttles.  The location is great, easy to find, close to Cerro, 10min walk to the centre and in a quiet area. Don't worry, it's safe!  Actually there's no volcano view from the property, but it's the first thing you see when you go out. There's a small parking, I suppose it's free for guests. Warm shower only at low water pressure. Average breakfast (chapin, traditional).  If you want to take a shuttle you should know that it's more than probable that you'll be the first in the bus. Great, you can choose your seat... In return be prepared for 30min cobbled road ride to collect all the passengers from other hotels. If you are late, they'll probably come back in 30 mins ;)\",\n \"We moved here from a lovely but far less functional hotel.  The location is great, the rooms are comfortable and everything works as it should.  No problem with hot water.  The price is reasonable for Antigua--we find bang for the buck to be much higher generally in Mexico, but... you're in Antigua!  Breakfast was included and adequate.  Staff friendly and helpful...out of a gazillion hotels in Antigua this appears to be a reliable option, and we would return.  Cannot recommend the shuttle van their lobby travel agent booked us on to Lake Atitlan--they put 13 in an 8 person van, a hellish 3 hour ride with no potty break!  Ack!\",\n \"We were only there one night but thought it was great. The price was reasonable for a great location and a pretty nice hotel. It was quiet, the beds were comfortable, and everything was clean. Breakfast was included and was better than we'd expected. We'd definitely return and recommend the Euro Maya to others.\",\n \"Clean, cozy & comfortable. You DO have to tell them when you'd like hot water, about 10 minutes before you want it or give them a time and for me it was on. Very hot and lots of it. Our room had 2 double beds, tv with satellite, closet and large bathroom with shower/tub. Internet connenection was poor in our room, but just outside our door in the courtyard was perfect. The breakfast was available from 7am to 11am, was a little different each day. But had boxed cereal, fruit, rolls, jam, yogurt, your choice of eggs, home fries, one day pancakes, they had a travel agent at the desk & were knowledgable about the attractions & the area. Close to everything, restaurants & shops in every direction. Just a 2 to 5 minute walk to the Central Park. Guides also available in this park area,\",\n \"We arrived at this hotel after an early start and long travel to be told immediately that there was no room for us due to an overbooking. This was despite our room being reserved and paid for in full for at least 2 months previous. We were told that they were upgrading us to their other property the Euro Maya Suites where the rooms were nicer apparently, after a quick check online I found out that to stay at the Euro Maya Suites it was indeed a little bit more expensive. BUT the reason I booked the Euro Maya was more for the location and the rooftop terrace which the other one didn't have. The girl on reception was very nice to us and did give us a small discount on an excursion to the Pacaya Volcano, the room at the suites was a lovely room and we had a great time in Antigua\",\n 'We so much enjoyed staying here. Every corner of the small intimate hotel was gorgeously decorated, its staff courteous and helpful. Breakfast was at its delightful courtyard, and they provide free drinks/tea in the afternoon. They have a good size rooftop seating area with an amazing view of the surrounding active volcanoes. Memorable stay.',\n 'Very Good Hotel. The staff was amazing. They will do anything to make your stay wonderful. Good breakfast, the rooms are big and comfortable, and a very good value. The only draw back is that you can not get internet in your rooms due to the large walls, but you can get internet in the beautiful gardens.',\n \"Through luck of the draw, we ended up with a huge 2 room suite. The rooms were amazing and we loved it. Access to many of the attractions of Antiqua is excellent. The WiFi signal was weak and worked best in the courtyard.  But the courtyard is so beautiful you'll want to spend time there anyway.\",\n 'The staff at this hotel was very friendly and knowledgeable. We asked for a restaurant that was close by and \"economically priced\" (i.e. cheap) they recommended Rincon Tipico (was great btw). The room was cute and clean but the bathroom wasn\\'t so great. The shower stall and toilet are separate and the doors are flimsy. Taking a shower was difficult because the water kept leaking out.   I never saw or are at the breakfast buffet (as described). Didn\\'t know it existed. The staff refered us to a restaurant next door.   The pool is not heated as described, either.  Aside from that, the service waa great and the views are incredible. This hotel is located near the square and very convenient for sightseeing.',\n 'This small hotel is right around the corner from the main square.  The staff were great!   They helped me line up transportation, were kind, and even knocked on my door at 330am to make sure I was awake!!! Service and lovely!!! ',\n 'I spent one night here and would have liked to have stayed longer if possible. I arrived late at night, with a prearranged airport pickup through the hotel. The taxi was there to meet me and check in was smooth even late at night. My room was really charming and clean. Breakfast the next morning was fantastic. Recommended!',\n 'A lovely, well-situated, budget to mid-range hotel. Pleasant staff, good housekeeping, basic room and a comfortable bed. A few steps from the main square. Central breakfast patio lends itself to interaction amongst guests. No complaints. Enjoyed our stay and we have booked for our return to Antigua in a few days time.',\n 'It is always a good  experience.we have been there already 3 times and we will continue visiting Antigua  Guatemala.Porta hotel is one of our favorites,the pool is amazing perhaps could use a little more heating for  the time of the year.The food is also great and the people who work there are very nice.',\n 'We stayed here 4 nights as a last minute change. We had booked to stay at Hotel Antigua but apparently there was an issue with our room, and no others available, so they moved us here. We were in a nice spacious Triple room (1 double, and 2 singles) with a fan (no ac) but it was cool in the evenings so a fan was adequate. The room did get quite stuffy though so we had to open the windows whenever we were in the room to air it. The shower was luke warm and would quickly lose the hot water, but still had good pressure. The various receptionists we saw during our 4 nights here spoke very little English but luckily we didn’t really need to speak to them much ! No breakfast included so you have to head out for food. When the wifi did work it was ok but slow. But it did occasionally',\n 'Pros- fantastic location, nice courtyard and roof terrace and kitchen was great as we could make our own breakfast   Cons- unfortunately none of that really mattered because the walls of the hotel rooms were so thin that we barely slept. As guests came back to the hotel during the night you could hear everything so clearly it was impossible not to be awoken. It finally got quiet around 1.30 am only for the  noise to start again around 3am as guests woke up presumably for early morning pick ups and hikes. For us it was too expensive for failing to provide decent sleep.   In addition the WiFi was really poor most of the time. Finally they provided free coffee but the coffee was rubbish and cups tasted of chlorine- small things but generally really disappointing. Would recommend',\n \"I stayed for 3 weeks as a solo female traveler. Positive: This hotel/ apartments look just like their photos.  They are nice looking...very cozy inside.  Housekeeping was very good but never came when they said they were coming and security was there. The beds were very very comfortable and their was good hot water.  There is a safe in the room which was great, but not sure if you could fit a full sized lap top in it.  For my I-pad it was perfect.  Wireless access was pretty reliable.  Even when I lost access it came back quickly.  Negative:  It's very noisy.  If no-one is on either side of you, it's okay, otherwise you hear everything.  Several times there were people partying quite loudly and went I spoke to the security guard, he spoke to the tenants but nothing changed. \",\n \"Our second time coming back in Antigua. After the recent experience of one hotel we had before, and barely space for the bags we book a triple room.  We booked the room through booking.com. The price was 80 US dollar for the night just before New Year's Eve in 2018.  Good location, many restaurants around. Friendly staff - however, Pablo and Luis don't speak English but tried their best to understand you.  We have the room on the upper floor next to a housekeeping room. At night we hear the laundry machine turning. It bothers me, as I'm not a good sleeper.  The room is okay but there mold on the ceiling. Good free wifi. The bathroom is small, not very clean. Difficult to regulate the hot water for the shower.  - There was a misunderstanding with an airport pick-up.  We book an\",\n \"Being my first time visiting Guatemala I wasn't sure how to evaluate the accommodation options, but one thing I was sure of is that I wanted to have an easy transfer from the airport (45 mins drive) to the hotel as I arrived at 11.30pm o XMas eve. As Posada offered this option and had availability - I booked - it was a GREAT DECISION.  The airport arrival can be overwhelming with the many taxi drivers lurking, and hoards of people waiting to welcome their family members. Our driver has a big clear sign and was an absolute delight!   The drive to Antigua is around 45 mins from the airport. We were thankful to have the hotel transfer as if you're not familiar with where you are, the dark drive can be daunting.  The receptionist was helpful and quick to respond on emails. The room\",\n 'The hotel is quaint, secure, and centrally located. The beds were comfortable, but the cleanliness of our sheets was questionable (stains and hair.) There are windows in the rooms that look into the garden common space, so the airflow in the room was limited, but there was a fan provided. The water pressure was good one day but the next day we had no running water (not sure if this was a freak accident or a common occurrence.) For our 24 hour stay in Antigua, this hotel did the job but will not be too memorable.',\n \"There were 3 of us sharing a room. Each had our own bed. It was clean and basic. The bathroom was a tight fit with only the one mirror. To get hot water, do not turn the pressure on too high. The staff were very kind and accommodating when we asked to move our room downstairs so we wouldn't have to carry our luggage up the narrow stairs.  It is near the center plaza with more than enough places near to eat and shop. Great for walking everywhere.\",\n 'My three young daughters and i stayed in El Marques over Semana Santa.  We were able to walk into town to enjoy the festivities and easily return to El Marques to relax.  The unit was clean, well appointed, and had all of the amenities we needed.  The on-site security and administrative staff were extremely helpful and kind.  They arranged transportation for us, directed us to a variety of activities, advised us on restaurants, and answered our many questions.  We will stay there again!',\n \"Too bad TripAdvisor doesn't allow audio uploads with their reviews. The owners of this place make so much noise at night, talking loud on the courtyard, listening to loud music at 4AM... If you want a good night rest, look further in Antigua \",\n \"Posada de San Jeronimo was a big disappointment. When I saw the room I thought, this is nice. But on closer inspection you soon realise this place was once some dirty hotel that has been made to look nice by painting a wall or two, adding a mood light, a nice design bed sheet... taking some nice photos like you see here, on the FB page. The reality is that the rooms are very dirty, it looked like my floor has not been cleaned in a long time. The bathroom was also bad and no hot water, eventually a bit warm but still a freezing shower. It is also very noisy because it's by the main street. I was in a room furthest away but if anyone talks at reception the noise is amplified by the design of the hotel. The door bell when someone comes back late is heard loudly in all corners of\",\n 'Pros: Beautiful hotel Contras: Horrible check in experience, inflexible policies that were not informed to me before arrival, zero will to solve the problem I had. The hotel is beautiful, but keep in mind that if you have a problem it will be a nightmare trying to solve it',\n 'Large and clean room. The rooms are on both sides of a colorful courtyard far away from the lobby but the staff carried our luggage. The hotel garden is full of plants and flowers well arranged. Regular breakfast and the waiters service need improvement.',\n \"Old style hotel on the outskirts of Antigua with excellent views of the surrounding volcanoes from the terrace restaurant. Good clean accommodation although a little basic. Friendly and helpful staff. Restaurant was a little more expensive than restaurants in town which are approx 20-30 mins walk away down Antigua's iconic cobbled streets. Slightly irritated that the hotel charges for bottled drinking water on the rooms and as previously noted some rooms on the exterior of the courtyarded garden suffer from road noise. Small bathing pool to ease those aching legs after a hard day sightseeing \",\n \"As recommended by my guide, I feel the cost of my stay was well worth it.  It's a bit of a walk from the city center (far NE corner of the area where most tourists roam), but definitely not an issue.  Christian and his staff were very accommodating and a pleasure to talk to.  Since part of the hotel is set up like a hostel, there is no shortage of conversation in the outside common area with interesting guests.  I enjoyed watching a local artist paint wall murals near the bunk rooms.  There's also a beautiful garden near the private rooms, and you can catch a nap outside easily if so inclined.  My only issue was I had a bit of trouble keeping warm in the room at night, and would say that the rooms might not be as well insulated as you would expect when the temperature gets down\",\n 'My bed was so hard that my wife took the other single bed as she could not sleep on the hard double. Lucky for her as I endured multiple bed bug bites and she got away scott free. Still itching now as I write this. Expedia promised 15m2 but had a room size of thimble but the great staff sorted it next day. Thanks. Roof top is great for breakfast. Kitchen good for basic meal only. Good for the price.',\n \"Overall the hotel was nice and the service was great. However you do NOT want to be iin Room 101 (or I would suggest 102 or 103) as these are right by the courtyard used for breakfast (set up starts at 05:30am) also any visitors arriving or leaving during the night will wake you. Also for Room 101 the window from the hotel toilet opens out into your bathroom - again noise by anyone using it overnight. Finally if you are there on a Saturday night the live rock band playing at the pub next door is effectively the other side of the wall to this room. We asked to be moved but were told there weren't any suitable rooms available. This was clearly untrue as we saw rooms come and go that were suitable and in a more quite location of the hotel.   All of that said if you aren't in rooms\",\n 'We made a reservation for the only location listed, located just off the Calle del Arco. When we arrived, a gentleman told our driver to take us to the \"other\" location. It was a decent location. The bathrooms were nice, breakfast was good. The best was comfortable. My frustration was that it was not the location we wanted. It was further from the center. Nor was it as charming.',\n 'As this place is so similar to their sister property, Euro Maya Suites, you may see a lot of similarity in reviews.  I returned to Antigua and decided to try this, the older sister, as it was only half a block from The Plaza.  A beautiful small hotel with an excellent staff and nice rooms.   With all the knick-knacks around it could also be a museum. The quirky intermingling of Mezoamerican artifacts and photos of European cities is strange; depending on how you look at it you may consider it charming or annoying.  My room was above average size and comfortable although there was only one somewhat easy chair, and no sofa, so two people would have some difficulties when it came to relaxation. The bathroom was adequate and it had hot water in the shower without having bare wiring',\n 'There was some confusion getting here, we thought we had booked the Euro Maya Suites but ended up at this location after calling to confirm.  Ok, fine.  The room was okay, pretty cramped.  The biggest issue is not only is there no AC, but also no overhead fan and the hotel has no fans to bring it.  It was so stuff and even leaving all windows open for cross-breeze, it was really stuffy.  It was nice to have breakfast on the roof and the breakfast was super plentiful and served by lovely staff.  Location is tops.',\n 'Gorgeous spacious rooms, with a nice tipico breakfast included. The all day complimentary coffee, tea and purified water was very convenient to have. Centrally located.  Unfortunately the shower water was cold.  Be sure to let the front desk know if you plan to return late at night, as we were locked out, despite using the door bell and calling the front desk, exhausted, we had to find alternate accommodations in the middle of the night.  After explaining this to the staff the next morning, we were refunded the fee for the night. ',\n \"We spent two nights here on our way to Lake Atitlan for a service trip. The location is close to a market and the park square.  Because of the concrete design of the walls all the noises would travel up the stairwell all night long.  A lot of 20 something's stayed here and didn't seam to care about hot much noise they made all night long. The rooms were sparsely decorated and could use upgrading on the beds, bedding and pillows. The public areas were pretty. Wifi worked in our room amd the breakfast area. I wouldn't stay here again.\",\n 'Spent one night and would not return. The downstairs room was subjected to noisy chatter by patrons all night long and even in the early morning (0400). There is a charge for everything - wifi, water. Positive: there is a supermarket right next door. Rooms are clean. Not worth the money spent on it $65USD/2 doubles in room (just needed one).',\n 'we got to the hotel after overseas flight so it was great for us, but i think you can find cheaper hotel for the same quality. the location is great close to canter and to the market. ask for the first floor to get better intrnet',\n 'Comfortable beds with ample blankets and pillows.

We have stayed at several hotels in Antigua and have always been very pleased with staff, service and accommodations at other hotels in the area.   This hotel has been the worst we have stayed at by far in this price range.  The receptionist was accommodating but slightly rude.  Definitely not friendly or personable and the staff acted like they didn't know what they were doing most of the time.  We stayed for two nights and politely asked if it was possible to change rooms after the first night because our room was located right next to reception desk which was very noisy and loud from people checking in and out all through the day and night we could not sleep.  The first room was very comfortable and\",\n \"My sister and I stayed at Hotel Casa del Parque recently and we had a wonderful visit. The hotel is very centrally located, within a few steps to the central park (where many restaurants, cafe's and shops are located) and artisanal markets. The staff were very friendly and helpful, directing us to the best place to exchange money, and helped us to arrange transportation to the airport. The pool was great - very refreshing and so appreciated after a day of sightseeing. The upper level has a great view of nearby ruins and the volcano, but we had a room on the lower floor and it was still great, with a view into the courtyard filled with plants and a fountain.\",\n 'Friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful courtyard. Good American breakfast. Even though their English was poor managed to get everything we asked for. The only complaint - no blow dryer available....Very cooperative when asking to leave suitcase or anything else.',\n \"Beautiful little hotel close to Central Park. I needed some peace and quiet and chose this hotel for the beautiful rooms and courtyard. The price was quite reasonable compared to other hotels in the area. Breakfast was continental but for the price I paid I didn't expect a feast. Wifi only worked in the courtyard, the signal was too weak in my room. All in all, a great stay.\",\n 'This place was clean and the staff was so helpful! They helped us find places we wanted to go and gave great recommendations! So easy to walk to the main square and right by La Merced. Little noisy on streets at night but not a problem!',\n \"I concur with johndaunt, this hotel is a little pricey, but they offer good service, classy rooms and an historic setting.   It is just 2 blocks from the main square and there is traffic, but we kept our windows closed and weren't disturbed. We were offered a cooked, or continental breakfast (which is included in the rate) and ate on their very pretty patio.   We heard no noise from other rooms and my only gripe would be that the bedrooms need more illumination. Hopefully they could do that tastefully without breaking up the colonial decor.   If you are considering this property, be aware that they have a sister hotel called the Palacio Chico 1940, so don't book the wrong hotel. Don’t know why this property sits so low in the TA listings, it is a good option for travelers\",\n 'We stayed here on our final night in Antigua the staff could not have been nicer they answered loads of questions for us and sorted an airport shuttle. The room was spotless and the shuttered windows ensured a solid nights rest. It is a little expensive for what you get in terms of breakfast which was only 2 pieces of toast, 2 small slices of watermelon and pineapple. We asked for eggs which they gave.   Bottled water was free and it is in a nice quiet area of the town. ',\n \"- Someone broke into my room and stole cash and expensive sunglasses. - Staff did not want to help - was very reluctant to inquire staff and other customers on the incident OR call police. Staff actually tried to imply I had lost items / not locked door/ fabricated the incident. The lack of assistance was as bad as the invasion of privacy, particularly for a young solo female traveller - 'Hotel' is actually a large house with rooms rented out - Was told no one else had keys to my room but staff later admitted the owner had a key - Local authorities i.e. the tourism police are very helpful\",\n \"The rooms were clean and nice. However you had to walk through the kitchen to get to shower. Also the family are there daily and live there i believe. They are always in the kitchen/dining area which is also the reception... Two nights out of three we were kept up by people or children talking loudly...one of these nights was 10pm ! It is more like air bnb where you stay with family.

I highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay here on my next trip to Antigua.',\n \"Our family of 2 adults and 3 kids stayed at this new hotel last month.  It has a great location of the hotel, it's within walking distance of the main plaza in a very quiet neighborhood, (also it's very close to the hotel Porta, which has a large swimming pool and a playground that non-guests can use by paying a daily fee, very convenient for our young kids!) The hotel del Marques features exclusively suites, we booked a large suite for 6 persons equipped with a kitchen,  and a washer & dryer all of which proved very useful!  The beds were new and very comfy, even the sofa-bed seemed good quality (my kids slept in it, not me though) The hotel is quiet, we couldn't hear any of the other guests, however the design of the suite is such that you'll hear from the bedroom located\",\n 'Sweet little hotel in the heart of downtown Antigua, Guatemala.

The first night we had two twin bed on the second night we were able to get a double bed in our room without changing the room which was very nice. The hot water was a little bit hard to regulate in the shower.

Rooms were spacious and comfortable, bathroom was clean with good water pressure. Great central location near the main plaza, grocery store and markets. Staff spoke english well enough.

The only thing that wouldve made this stay perfect would have been hot water in the shower. ',\n \"Not really clean hotel, smells bad and very noisy over night. It's quite close to the parque central though and the guardians were friendly.

The room was furnished simply, but it was very adequate.  We had a lower floor room, but I think upstairs might be quieter.  There is no air conditioning, so the upper floor might be pretty warm in the summer.',\n 'It’s on the outside of town which means large coaches can stop here so groups like it and although at night on the whole it’s quieter than sleeping in town as it also caters for functions and we had one evening where we were disturbed by a band quite late into the night.  Add to this the tour groups arriving and departing in the nighttime hours and voices and suitcases bumping along the cobbles reverberating around the complex and it doesn’t always make for a peaceful sleep.  It looks OK on the surface and is tastefully done up to look like an old colonial town and has a nice courtyard garden area but it lacks charm or personality, the staff aren’t particularly friendly, the rooms are rather dated and certainly the ground floor ones smelt damp and needed airing, and the beds',\n 'I stayed for two nights with my family in late December.  The hotel setting (grounds, buildings, ambiance) is five stars and amazing.  Kudos to the hotel for improving the museums, which are really interesting and worth a visit whether or not you stay at this hotel.  However, the food and room were not too impressive- three stars.  The room smelled smoky as there was a fireplace and a little card that instructed people not to have fires... well, then maybe you should take out the wood of the fireplace so that people do not light fires!  We had two meals at the hotel- an average breakfast with very slow service and sandwiches at the pool, which were not very good. All in all, an enjoyable 2 days, but the hotel could do better.',\n 'It was nicely located just 5min from city. Nice to have breakfast on the rooftop. Rooms and hotel was quite nice.

Overall for the price (over 100 usd) I am sure there are better other choices.',\n 'The communal areas here are lovely. Grear coffee too. But the first room I got given absolutely stank of a stong chemical smell which I can only imagine is the floor cleaner. I asked to be moved, 5 minutes jn there made me nauseous. The next room also smelled old and is run down.  Road noise very loud!  The mattress doesnt have a mattress protector, the  thin  fitted sheet goes straight on the matress which is just gross. Thumbs down for me.',\n 'This hotel is a cosy little oasis, set in the lovely colonial town of Antigua. The courtyard within the hotel is beautiful and its landscape ; simple and yet stunning , making us feel right at home. It’s just great to be able to chill at the courtyard sipping coffee or a beer.  The staffs are all friendly and very helpful, passionate and knowledgeable. The staff helped us booked most of our activities at great prices and we are so grateful for all the tips. The rooms are big, simple and yet functional . Hot water is available but can take a few minutes to flow through the shower, so a little of patience help.  Overall this is a nice place to stay, and i would recommend checking it out.',\n 'This is a very nice 3 Star Hotel. Not in the center of the town, but not far from everything. Just 4 blocks away from the Main Plaza (Parque Central de la Antigua Guatemala). I would say the location, a little bit away is better to have a tranquil night.

But inside you will be presented by a huge garden very well taken care of. There is no parking. People are very attentive and always smiling. The room is very comfy, good bed, small tv that I did not try. In my room (19) there was 2 queen beds. My only complain is the shower, difficult to get to a constant water temperature. Sometimes too hot, sometimes colder. But nothing that bothered too much. I do',\n 'We found the staff at the hotel very friendly. The room had charm as well as all the amenities we needed.

Maria on reception is fantastic and organised Spanish lessons for me with an awesome  private tutor that I had at the hostel.   The location is awesome. A 30 second walk to the square and loads of nice resteraunts and bars.

The location is excellent, but if you are not capable of walking up a flight of steep stairs, then this place may pose a challenge for you.  The front desk help will assist you with the bags, but maybe not so much if you have a very early check out the next morning.  This is a simply furnished hotel among many similar offerings.

Rooms are clean and spacious.   Negatives - there is no free wifi! This was a real sticking point for me, as the hotel advertises free wifi, yet you have to pay Q20 every 24 hours for the wifi code, which they will type into your device so you can't share it with others.

It was central to everything, the park, markets, restaurants and bars. It has  the old colonial feel to it. The beds and pillows comfortable, great WiFi, hot water, free drinking water, free coffee and tea. Beer for sale in cooler, cheap price. Nice courtyard and a top terrace with great views. Very secure. The best though is the staff was very friendly and helpful. The only down side, is that the terrace needs new cushions for chairs and to be more inviting, so much potential there.

Really close to the city square, great pubs and food and very easy to navigate around.   The view on the rooftop at night was my favourite!

We originally had a room by the roadside and it was a bit noisy in the early morning, but we were able to change rooms given it was low season. The hot water works, but requires a bit of patience.

We used the shared bathrooms which were sufficient. Best part about Casa Jacaranda is the nice breakfast in the garden. The food and the coffee were awesome and a nice start for a long day!  Casa Jacaranada is a good hostel for a fair price situated near the city centre of Antigua. The breakfast in de the garden is awesome!',\n 'I stayed in the only small room in the hotel on the main floor which I suspect makes a big difference. It had next to no natural light and I found it cold. It was also a bit loud from upstairs and reception. That said, it was a good deal, it is quite lovely inside, the staff were great, it had free water and the included breakfast at Don Diego is one of my favs in town. So all in all it was a good stay. ',\n 'There are two units on the top floor, one with a rooftop view of the volcano and La Merced. My wife and I stayed in that one, \"Catedral,\" for four nights. We were afraid there would be a stampede of drunks on the roof every night, but we didn\\'t hear a peep. It\\'s a layer of concrete between the top and the room. The staff was friendly. They didn\\'t even get mad at me for making coffee in the general area–I wake up at 5 am–using our bag of grounds every morning. We had WiFi issues, but not the hotel\\'s fault. I tested their speeds at 8-9 Mbps, but it would drop to 0 intermittently, indefinitely. It seemed, the whole town was that way. Had I needed the WiFi for work, it would have been a problem. There is parking, but it\\'s $18/day for 24/7 parking. Our reservation came with free',\n 'The hotel is perfectly located in the city centre, in 2-minute walk from Plaza Mayor / Parque Central. Its rooms are spacious and clean, and a courtyard with a fountain adds something positive. However, the entrance is almost unnoticeable from the street (see photo). Panoramic views from the terrace at the third level are perfect. While staying there, I could see an eruption of one of nearby volcanos. English-speaking receptionists are friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, breakfasts were not offered at all. Hotel staff recommended me a partner restaurant near Arco de Santa Catarina. Just by chance, I came across a small café between the hotel and Plaza Mayor (5a Calle Poniente, between 5a and 6a Avenida Sur – see photo) that served only breakfasts between 06:30 am and 11:30 am,',\n 'Great location, only a couple blocks from the main square. Free coffee available from early morning, free distilled water available in multiple locations within the hotel, quiet setting around a large colonial quad, and an incredible rooftop area that you usually have to yourself. Very helpful staff. We climbed Volcan Acatenango and returned to San Vicente for one last night, which felt like paradise after such an exhausting adventure!  It was not that full when we were there.',\n 'We stayed here with our family (including two 6 & 8 year boys) and enjoyed our stay. The rooms are good sized and we used the wel equipped kitchen al lot to be able to give our boys a taste of home at times. For USD 5 you can use the pool at one of their more luxureous hotels. For beautiful sunsets check out the roof terrace!',\n 'We stayed at Hotel Posada for two nights, crashing there after arriving from the Guatemala City airport and before heading off to Atitlan. It was just fine for these purposes. It felt clean and secure and was right in the thick of things in Antigua. We were able to spend a whole day exploring on foot.   Like everywhere else in Central America, the beds were harder than what we are used to in the US. However, you are not going to get fancy, imported, fluffy, foreign beds for this price. Sheets were clean and towels were provided.  We used the airport transfer, which was SUCH a convenience. The staff helped us book our bus to Atitlan, and they were able to watch our bags in the time between check out and our bus pick-up. There is a small courtyard in which to sit and drink beer',\n 'Great little stay in the heart of Antigua! Close to everything and very central. Though it was simple, the hotel was clean and had everything we needed. We stayed in a big group and they were easily able to accommodate to everyone.',\n 'Staff in the morning were very rude and loud at 6am, No wifi which they told me there was when i arrived late at night in need of internet to get in touch with other people i was meant to be traveling with. Also said it was cheaper that night then the morning charged me more. Bugs all in the bathroom in the morning from out of the rotten wooden door. The only up was location close to cafe where i could get wifi which was apparently down in the area …..',\n 'This was a nice hotel with helpful staff. The rooms were comfortable and the whole place seemed very secure (front doors of the hotel were locked at all times and required you to get buzzed in). Purified water was available on the second floor for you to refill your bottle. Pretty close walking distance to the city plaza.',\n \"Good location, clean , a bit noisy, not much character  Roof area could be utilised much better, they could do so much more with this area  There are better options in Antigua, but this hotel is fine if you don't have a choice (group trip, etc)\",\n 'Location is great, very central to town center.

The rooms and the bathrooms are a bit on the small size. Closet space is limited or none existent depending on the room. Lighting in the rooms is poor. The water pressure in the showers is excellent. The mattresses are super firm, almost too firm. The room had plenty of blankets and very comfortable pillows.  The grounds are beautiful. Water and coffee are available in the common areas 24 hours a day. The coffee always tasted fresh. Security at the hotel is outstanding. The ladies working the front desk were always smiling and helpful.  Breakfast was slow but tasty. Only one person was working the breakfast buffet and she was\",\n 'Good location and plenty of greenery and flowers. Stayed recently for 5 nights within 2 week period in 3 different double rooms - I would recommend 105 and 113 over 117 which is smaller and lacks some things that the other two have. All rooms were very clean and well maintained. Breakfast basic but tasty. Internet painfully slow',\n 'Had 3 nights at beginning our cycling trip and one at end. Short, 10mins or so, walk from main plaza, pleasantly quiet, clean comfortable rooms. Coffee, tea and water always available. Breakfast good, best if you can select night before. Seemed good value for money. As has been mentioned the room nearest the entrance can be a bit noisy and people often turn up quite late as flights into Guatemala City from Europe arrive about 9pm.',\n \"Woke up at 3am for the 4am airport shuttle, and found these nasty creatures crawling on the sheets. So disgusted and worried about spreading them to my home.   I stayed at a different property of the same owner and it was nice and clean, and I didn't see evidence of bugs there. When they didn't have available rooms, they referred me here and it was a completely different experience.\",\n \"I had been travelling for 17 hours on shuttle and got there and they were probably a bit too strict for my liking. Couldn't even go to the kitchen to make myself a cup of tea before bed as it shuts ridiculously early. Though I must say it is a clean, safe and reliable Hostal. I just didn't enjoy my time there now. Also I myself am not a smoker but note you will have to leave the hostel and go into the street to smoke.\",\n \"Stayed 3 nights with my partner in a double ensuite room. Rooms are small, clean & comfortable. This is a small & quiet hostel and in an excellent location. There's a St Martin bakery just across the road, and lots of bars and restaurants nearby. Definitely a good choice if you're looking for budget accommodation. Nice views of the volcano from the terrace but unfortunately they shut it early. Wifi ok. Staff friendly - they organised early transportation to the airport in Guatemala City for us.\",\n 'We stayed 3 nights , the staff are very kind, the host speak fluently english and was very helpful with everything.  Location is a bit far from center town (4-5 min walk) but no big issue..  The price is high  for a private room even though we got a discount for long stay.. hot water is tricky  , breakfast includes and was awesome!! Free water fill and a ping pong table :)',\n \"Think it was run by a Californian family, the boy that was on reception was very cute and appeared to run the whole hostel in a very organised, professional and efficient manner. He was welcoming, attentive and helpful - a credit to the hostel. The rooms were clean and came with fluffy blankets which was a nice addition. Advertised as hot showers but we didn't have a hot one during our stay - not sure why? The free breakfast included is great. The pancakes were large and very tasty. If you want a different breakfast or to add or remove something from your dish they are very accommodating. Best free coffee served during breakfast too!! The wifi works really well and it's only a short 5 min walk into the Central Park and 900metres away from the lookout so great spot. \",\n 'Casa Encantada was a great place to stay. It’s not far from the center of Antigua and I felt completely safe. The hotel is very small and you will not find the amenities of a larger hotel. But every person that worked the front desk greeted me by name every time I saw them, which is something you don’t normally get. The hotel also has a sister property up the street and all guests at Casa Encantada can use their facilities (pools, retaurants etc.)  I’ve read other reviews that complain about how noisy it is. And it’s true you do hear noise coming from the street. But I also stayed at a higher end hotel during my trip and had the same problem. Noise is just normal here. If you need complete silence when you sleep then I would suggest bringing earplugs.   Thanks Casa Encantada.',\n \"First,  the new woman who runs the place is very nice and very helpful.  BUT, this place is no longer a quiet hotel but a hostel.  People were chatting in the courtyard until I finally asked them to stop at 2:30.  As a hostel I'm sure it is fine, but I would not recommend it for quiet.  It's also not as clean as it used to be.\",\n 'We stayed at the lovely Casa Santo Domingo. Arriving here is so nice.   Especially in the evening when all candles are lit, it is a very elegant place to arrive to after flying into busy Guatemala city. All of Antigua is so beautiful and worth a visit when in Guatemala.   We liked staying at this hotel very much. The rooms were nicely connected and located in a quiet area of the Hotel. The hotel is also a museum which is an amazing additional facility as walking through the hotel is truly fascinating. The staff is very kind, although less than 50% speaks basic English. Rooms were nice, hotel’s pool is child-friendly. Spa facilities were nice, massage was very good. Location is excellent. Restaurant was nice, room service was great. We can recommend staying here with children.',\n \"Left after they changed a confirmed rate, try to steal credit card informations found policies which were not right, the staff looks really incompetent, told me first by credit card they would reserve $100, after I refused they told me on debit card they can authorize $ 200, I refused so they told me I can deposit $200, cash also that I refused he called the manager which was hiding somewhere, he told me they will make an acception and do not charge me, I agreed but they make a copy of my card on a paper so that's fraud and not authorized data theft, specially I refused since beginning. Take care that they not steal your data and check rates on booking.com as they try to trick you on prices.\",\n \"Pretty, comfortable and clean. Upstairs loft large bedroom and bed and downstairs sitting room and bath.  Shower had drain problems that were addressed by removing drain lid.  Breakfast (or sac lunch) okay and appropriate.  Thin walls and not thoughtful guests a problem (and chicken bus callers in early am), otherwise a quiet and convenient location. Weak WIFI modem (I requested  a close room from other reviews) only had signal downstairs or in lobby, not in bedroom.  I was only in room from 6 pm to 7 am because of work.  Travel agent in lobby on weekends (? weekdays) was great for excursions.  All staff were friendly and very willing to help, but many didn't speak or barely spoke English.  Alicia Estrada was the main desk staff person who spoke English well, always smiled, and\",\n \"Built in the traditional style around a central courtyard, this hotel has both noise and air circulation problems. The surrounds are quiet at night, but all it takes is one guest or group doing something as simple as having a chat outside their room, and everyone can hear it. Once the windows are closed there is no air circulation and the room becomes quite humid. Bed was reasonably comfortable, but the polyester blanket increased the discomfort caused by poor air circulation. The hottest the water got was tepid. Room was clean and spacious and breakfast was perfectly adequate.  There are no facilities for the secure safekeeping of passports and valuables. If you're catching an early flight - ours was the 6.30 to Flores - consider a taxi or private shuttle. The 4am shuttle\",\n \"I think the place is appropriate.  Great location. Half a block away from the central park.  Had an issue with hot water the first day I was there.  No hot water after coming back from climbing pacaya. Had to take a cold water shower. Staff was accomodating but not being able to count on hot water is a problem. Got it resolved. Thank you.  Front rooms are noisy. And don't let them give you the room above reception. No pool. Breakfast was good. I'm fine with black beans, plantains, and some eggs. No hot water on the bathroom sink. So shaving for guys is tricky if you use a blade.  Consider how many people have submitted reviews for this hotel. \",\n 'Stayed here (not Euro Maya Suites) for one night but would have enjoyed more nights had my itinerary allowed.  The room was pleasant, the bed comfortable and included a couch/foton..  There is a big window at the front of the room and one at the rear that opened to an adjoining building.  The room has an LCD TV with a variety of free channels and pay per view.  The bathroom was good sized and included a hair blower; hot water was available almost instantaneously.   The building has ample places to sit and relax outside any room.  Tables and chairs are positioned on the walkway around the atrium which provides an open air feel.   Breakfast was provided in a nice cozy little dining area but was unremarkable.  Juice, coffee, breads, and cold cereal were served.

It has an excellent atmosphere and included breakfast.  It is close to everything, and super clean.  The only complaint is that we could hear some noise on the street in the morning, but that was completely overshadowed by how wonderful our room was.  We had a two story loft, and it was gorgeous.  I am from Guatemala City but live in the U.S., I would definitely recommend this hotel.  Great prices and overall wonderful stay.',\n 'We have stayed here many times. Always treated like family by Luis (owner) and Hugo (#1 back up to Luis) and Clara (housekeeping and more). This was one of our longest stays (7 nights). We were treated to an eruption by the volcano Fuego. About 11 miles distant and the wind was in our favor. Great viewing from the roof. The place is as eclectic as always. Very reasonable. Close to central square (1-1/2 blocks). Convenient to most everything else.',\n 'Greetings all!  Here it is in a nutshell.  Overpriced.  Room too small to accommodate a single persons luggage.  No place to hang clothes.  One spigot of cold water in the sink.  Spider on my towel, on removing it the rack fell to the floor.  Room  behind kitchen bad due to chatty cooks at 6 am.  Today second day, loud music at 6 am.  No rest for the weary.  Minimal breakfast offered so ate out.  Staff good!  For the money you can do much better!  Try Hotel San Jorge, cheaper, and much better.  Would not stay here again.  If not for lost luggage by United, delivered 44 hours after arrival, I would have moved. Mosquitoes in room.  No screens on window.',\n 'As you enter the courtyard, you are assailed by a collection of plants, pictures, memorabilia, and icons.  It is visually fascinating to walk around this hotel.  Antiques and oddities are perched harmoniously though the halls, up the stairs, and out to the roof top patio.  The communal kitchen is clean, and cozy.  The rooms were super quiet and spacious - and the restrooms were spotless with lovely hot water!  We had a small balcony where we could peek out at the stars...',\n \"I stayed there on December 27 and 28, 2013.  It's a very small hotel and that was one of the reasons we wanted to stayed there.  We were 30 of us so we rented the whole hotel , but when we got there they had only 5 out the 7 rooms reserved for us. We should of known then that it wasn't going to be a good experience.  The rooms were not what they said and advertise in the internet, one of the rooms had no running water so the bathroom was not working , none of the rooms had potable water other rooms had no tv in total they were not to the quality we were expecting. The worst part the hotel is being run by a Colombian woman maned ROCIO who has no business ethic she plain stole money from us by asking us for more money when we complained about the lack of services and such.

Having a print out of my reservation that clearly stated my request and confirmation was useless. The restaurant is not very good.',\n \"Rooms are very clean but small, bathroom is split into three (shower, sink and WC) where a built in wardrobe would have been, making it impossible to have privacy. Bar next door hosts a karaoke night during the week, this continues until the early hours and with poor induration and no double glazing we were up till 1am. Pool doesn't have many loungers and can be very loud when families are around. Great view of the volcanos makes up for the 3 star review.\",\n \"We stayed here with two children aged 6 and 10, and we had a lovely time.  It's a small place and not overly luxurious, but the gardens are beautiful, the location is perfect, the staff was very helpful, and the room was very comfortable.  Breakfast by the pool with a view of the volcano in the background was a perfect way to start each day.  The pool is small and a little chilly, but the kids still enjoyed it.The shower wasn't great, either the water pressure or the drainage, but that wasn't a big deal.  The only real problem, as others have said, was the noise.  Weeknights were just fine, but the one weekend night we were there it was even worse than I had imagined, and we had a second floor room away from the street. We closed all our room windows, used our phones as white\",\n 'Excellent location and service overall.  I enjoyed the daily breakfast that was available when you wanted it.   Only downside is that the room itself lacked privacy (thin walls) and the church bells every morning (early) were a bit annoying.  It is a small price to pay for a great location.',\n \"We spent three nights here.  While it was okay, it was not what was promised in its write up.  If there was a gallery, it's long gone.  So is the wine tasting and sales and so is the breakfast, which is included, but served at a coffee shop three doors down.  The mattress was in need of  replacement, sheets and towels were clean and newer. One can see that at one time, it had a lot of promise but money or enthusiasm has waned in it's maintenance.\",\n \"I have stayed at this Hotel three times. Each time I was with a large group (18 people). The rooms were clean, everything was in walking distance and they were very friendly. I have thought about going to another Hotel when I return next year but I won't because I love this one.\",\n \"Very friendly staff that are knowledgeable of the area, and will help out with any questions you have. Rooms are barebones, which is perfect if you just need a place to clean up and sleep like I did. Right around the corner from central park and the market. The only real downside is a large group that came in and kept slamming their doors whenever they left. Some kind of door dampers installed would be a great way to cut out the noise from rowdier neighbors. Aside from that, I didn't hear any noise from the local clubs/parties going on.\",\n 'This hotel has a friendly staff who can help with your questions about getting around Antigua. This is a big plus if you are on your first trip to Antigua. It is very close to parque central and many other highly visited areas. We found the room to be basic and clean but very noisy.  This hotel is also used for a language school so there were many young people there.',\n 'We received a small room on the first floor with private bath. Pretty basic but nice enough. Rooms have a window facing the hall that let in all the outside noise. We were woken up multiple times by loud guests.  Has a nice courtyard, dining area and lounge area.',\n 'Comfortable hotel at a fair price. Rooms are clean and adequate. The hotel feels very secure and it in a good location - between the market and the main square, with many restaurants just around the corner. Fast wifi and a strong signal in the rooms. This is a good choice for couples looking for a nice place to crash in Antigua.',\n \"We were there last month and we thought its location was great. Just a short five minute walk from the Mercado de Artesanias and from the famous arch. The hotel itself is small. The rooms are of decent size. The bathrooms definitely need a little attention. They don't have a parking area, but they did recommend a parking area at another hotel that was also a short walk away.  The service was nice and friendly. We arrived late and went in and out a couple of times during the night and they were always ready to see if we needed any help.   Pros: Excellent location Friendly service Great wifi connection (better than other wifi connections in Guatemala)  Cons: Bathrooms No parking  I would stay here again :) \",\n 'We booked 5 out of the 8 rooms for our group and we had a blast! The staff is very nice and the rooms are adequate and very clean. The courtyard on ground floor served as our \"living room\". We would all sit down there and visit in the evenings and mornings. The had a refrig to store food in and we had use of a toaster oven and microwave oven. It was perfect for our group! Every morning the volcano had a different look and my daughter took a picture of it daily! We stayed upstairs and would leave our windows and door open to let the air flow through.',\n \"We stay only for 1 night and ran away from this bad place. The girl in the front desk promised us a hot water, but it wasn't right. The water was ice cold!! The room was dirty, the sheets and towels were stained and we had a huge spider in the room. Plus, it was noisy at night due to a bar next door. We had a terrible night and run away in the morning. For this amount of money (32$ per night and in weekend even More!!) you better looking for another place.\",\n 'We have enjoyed our visits lately to Hotel Posada San Vicente...good rates, clean rooms, hot showers and very close to all things good in town.  The roof deck provides a wonderful panoramic view of the city, especially at sunrise and sunset!!',\n 'We stayed 5 nights here. The rooms are quaint but the courtyard a bit noisy. The hotel hosted several large groups. My parents had to change rooms to accommodate other people. Their second bed was \"itchy\" but I hate to speculate why. Access to the kitchen was useful for leftovers. Terrace had great 360 views of the city and volcanos, including the very active El Fuego. ',\n \"We were disappointed with Posada San Vincente - for what we were paying we really expected much better.  Hot water was limited and not really ever properly hot. The courtyard is very noisy. Rooms are small and not well ventilated. There were two small soaps but the place doesn't even supply shampoo. We just felt like we were constantly getting ripped off by the place.  We booked the airport transfer and we drove around picking people up at their respective hotels and waiting for guests to arrive from other transfers for 1 hour and 15 minutes before we actually got on the road to the airport so make sure you leave a wide margin of time.  The wifi did work fine for us and the rooftop terrace is nice for the view.\",\n 'I spent a few nights at this hotel recently, and it was a perfect home base for our time in Antigua. It was a short walk to most of the main tourist sites and near a great grocery store. The hotels courtyard is truly lovely and brimming with healthy plants. Kudos to the gardener!  Our double room was on the 2nd floor, and it was simple and clean. Daily housekeeping did a great job. My favorite thing about this hotel is the rooftop terrace - The 360 views of the volcanoes are amazing. Agua, Fuego and Acatenango are easily visible (if the weather is clear) and there is a nice view of Saint Joseph Cathedral as well. A perfect spot to enjoy a relaxing afternoon break from exploring.   Everyone on staff was friendly and welcoming. The only criticism I have is that there was little',\n 'We visit the place a couple w 2 small kids. Arrived late. We asked before the hotel to stay on the ground floor. When we came at midnight with two sleeping kids from the airport. The guy insist to put us on 2nd floor. No elevator. He insist there is no room down. What was wrong. After I insist to be on the ground floor, as I ask few days before he gave us this small room.  I liked the yard and the location. Shower Ammm what to say. Funky head and not really hot. In general Beautiful small yard. Central place. The room very small. But clean. Most of the team lovey. Tv old style.  And can be noisy from the room around. ',\n 'It’s an ok hostel. It’s a little tired in places and sadly not the cleanest. I had to change beds as I woke up with bites after the first night.   The kitchen is alright and has pots and pans. Cutlery and plates are a little battered and the lack of good cleaning products means that people can’t / don’t really clean things thoroughly.   It has a good social vibe and nightly events. Good for tours and shuttles.   We stayed somewhere else on our way back through Antigua. ',\n \"I booked here specifically because I was told it was quiet. When I saw my room was far from the busy street noise outside I figured it would be a good nights sleep. Unfortunately the BLARING TV was on until 10:30pm then turned back on at 7AM. It was an exceptionally unpleasant way to wake up. When I went to complain at the front desk I saw there were actually 2 TV's on and no guests were present! I got the girl at reception to turn off 1, but she seemed like she could have cared less and went back to watching her show.  Then I go to order the free breakfast (burned pancakes, no butter, gross marmalade, ) & they have ....techno blaring in the garden. Sorry, but I paid extra to get a nice experience not to hear some random TV commercials and your terrible music. The room was fine.\",\n \"Nice place. Clean and very spacious. Comfortable beds, hot showers and free breakfast. Nice TV lounge and helpful staff. The dorms only have 6 beds in them and so are nice. Around are several stores for food and drink and restaurants. It is a 5 minute walk to the Central Park. It's about an easy 10 minute walk to the public bus park and market. Free WiFi. Thoroughly recommended.\",\n 'I have to be honest I was expecting a bit more based on the photos and description, but we still had a comfortable 2 night stay here. The photos must have been taken some time ago as the rooms are now a bit tired (dirty carpet, mould on walls and dead mosquitoes squashed on walls).  However, the courtyard is nice and they have a parrot by reception too! Nice location on a quiet street but only a 5 minute walk from the main square. Breakfast isn’t included though as it states on here, it is extra. Free coffee and drinking water was nice though!

Kind and friendly staff. Very good bed. The room gets cleaned every day. Not the best shower, but warm which was nice. Breakfast is okay. Location is great!

It’s a little further out of the town so I’d say it’s better to spend a few extra dollars for a better location.',\n 'We stayed here for 4 nights in Dec 2017. Hotel staff friendly & welcoming, the staff spoke English & appreciated my efforts to speak Spanish! Hotel is in a quiet location but neat the main plaza, lovely courtyard. Breakfast served on the roof  terrace by attentive staff, breakfast was lovely. Fabulous views from roof terrace, especially when a volcano in the distance began to  emit smoke/ash...very exciting !

If needed, the hotel can arrange for your laundry to be done for you if you are there for a couple of days.',\n \"I just stayed one night.  The location is good - six blocks from the central plaza and very quiet.  The free breakfast is decent and the large courtyard is nice.  The showers are cold, however, despite having electric shower heads (I talked to others and they couldn't get hot water, either).  Antigua mornings can be chilly and a cold shower was not welcome! The workers were all very kind and helpful!\",\n 'We stayed 3 nights at Los Enquentros. We had the suite on the first floor with direct access onto the roof terrace. The ground floor rooms look a bit small and dark but are much cheaper. The decor is quirky and old fashioned but we had plenty of space and everything was clean and comfortable. The shower was hot as long as you turn it up very gently. I enjoyed sitting on the roof early in the morning and watching the birds visit with the volcanos in the background. Breakfast was nice and the owner, Irma, could not have been more helpful. The location is great, being just a few blocks from the Parque Central.',\n \"This place is definitely not ideal. It's very dirty, the sound proofing is extremely bad, and the lady's common areas are a hoarder's paradise. We were glad to get out of here. Only upside is that the lady is very nice and helpful. Still would not recommend it.\",\n \"We crashed here one night before leaving for the airport.  We go to Guatemala rather frequently and wanted to stay somewhere other than GC.  The manager lady (I don't remember her name) was fabulous.  She was up with us when we came in, and then up again when we left.  We were able to pay in American dollars, and we were able to include the cab ride to the airport the next morning.  (A tip- tell them your flight leaves 30 minutes before it actually does.  Our cab driver was at least a half hour late picking us up, and we had a nail biting drive to the airport.  Good thing the flight was delayed.)The hotel was sprawling with lots of courtyards and a rooftop terrace.  The rooms were good sized and clean.  Same with the bathroom.  The shower has that electric water heater that most\",\n 'I went to a wedding and a table collapsed on me full of glass vases. Could of got killed or maimed and no one from the staff apologized or did anything. They did send out a medic for the cut I had in my hand  and acted like it was my fault. I was just sitting there when it happened. Service was bad and you can hear the staff talking about you in Spanish. I would not recommend staying here.',\n 'I enjoyed my entire stay at this property.  It is located just a couple blocks away from everything we wanted to see.  I highly recommend room number 1.  It is 2 level room with plenty of hot water.  The front desk service was fast and courteous.  The breakfast is what you can expect from this type of hotel, and I have no complaints about it.  I will make this property my base every time I visit Antigua. If I have one complaint, it is the mattress.  Please upgrade your mattress quality, and I can rate this property higher.',\n \"Good hotel, great room, great location. The breakfast wasn't so good thought. the room was very private and clean. The service was good and it was a great way to start our traveling! we recommand on the upper level rooms.\",\n 'I went with my wife to this boutique hotel in Antigua Guatemala, and stay in the luxury suite that has a balcony. All the furniture were new and nice. The hotel has few rooms, so you felt that you are in your private mansion. Very quiet and romantic atmosphere. Walkable distance to major attractions in Antigua. Staff  helpful and friendly. ',\n \"We saw this hotel here and decided to visit to see if it was a place we'd like to stay another weekend. The employee who opened the door wouldn't let me in to check it out. Reservation only, he said. I said I only wanted to see the hotel and get pricing information, he said no and then opened the door so I could see the parking lot, but wouldn't let me enter. This was so insulting and outrageous.  We never will make a reservation now.\",\n \"It's a great hostel in Antigua if you're looking for a relaxed stay in a comfortable hostel in a great location (2 blocks from parque central). They're strict about noise after 9pm so it's not a party hostel. For partying we were able to go to other hostels just fine and come back to this hostel late at night so was perfect! Often had free coffee and water, and the wifi was good. Provided towels and had great showers and beds, as well as a kitchen available. Other guests were travellers too and met some great people. Would highly recommend!\",\n \"Stayed here one night, I must admit it was a random choice the night before leaving Guatemala, but totally fine. We had a private room with a clean shower, but very basic bathroom and signs everywhere reminding us of the different penalties we could experience if we left dirty towels, used both beds if we weren't 3 persons (one queen size and one single bed) - resulting in an additional charge on the bill, well, the list went on. Also, the doors weren't closed even if we locked them, they were easily pushed away and consecutively open.  They offer a 24h open reception with snacks and beverages. \",\n \"Nice and clean. Cheap and cheerful. Good location, close to centre, but on a quiet street. Hot showers pretty good.   The only downside is the rooms aren't very soundproof, you can hear people/cleaners on rooftop terrace moving furniture around.   \",\n \"This place isn't great, the staff is pretty rude and there are 100 rules unnecessary posted everywhere. The terrace closes early so you can't hang out anywhere. We wanted to switch the night we stayed to do the volcano with a friend and she said no then asked the next day if we were doing it that day (obviously it was too late). Also strick rule about only being allowed to use the bathroom in your dorm which is tiny and awkward if you have to use the washroom as a female. \",\n 'Overall good hotel. All staff were super cordial and attentive. We got a room with a window on a main street so sleeping on a Friday night was challenging. We requested to be moved to a different room and the experience was way better. Nice hotel',\n \"The hotel is beautiful, clean and well maintained, and the staff is good.  Our room was beautiful, airy and spacious, with an ingenious separation of toilet, shower and sink that worked well.  Gorgeous flowering plants are everywhere and well maintained, and the pool is sparking and warm.  There is coffee, tea and water available.  Wi-fi is a strong signal. The ONLY downside is the bar next door.  We didn't have trouble sleeping, but you need to be able to sleep through a heavy bass beat and bar noise that lasts from 7 pm until 1 am.  We accepted this as the trade-off for the excellent location.  You are a well-lit half block from the central square, so safe for going to restaurants and shops at night.\",\n \"Casa del Parque was just OK...the rooms had a musty smell because there is no proper ventilation in the bathroom (which was small).  The room was spacious but hot with only one fan in the room (a lot of the hotels don't have air conditioning). It's a great location but can be pretty loud because it's close to bars, but that can be a good thing if you plan to consume a lot of alcohol...you won't have far to walk.   Overall, Antigua is a great city and when I return I'll definitely stay at another hotel that's a little more upscale and offers breakfast and has a larger pool. \",\n 'Great location, lovely and courteous staff! We stayed in room #2 which had a nice view of the church across the street, a little drafty but nice decor. The place was over all very quiet, probably because we stayed during low season. A bit expensive considering all the accommodation options in Antigua though!',\n 'I have stayed at Palacio Chico several times with mission team groups. It gets us an evening where we can tour the markets, and is very close to several places to eat. They are very accomodating to let us double or triple up. The facility is clean, quiet, and the staff always helpful.   Las Torches across the street is a good restaurant, with easy walking to Palacio Chico. Pricey wine, but the food is fairly priced for the area.',\n 'This hotel was centrally located to great restaurants, central park. The room we had #6 was fabulous! Beautiful decor, nice touches, etc. the staff was helpful and courteous.The patio/garden was lovely w/parakeets that kept you company while you had a simple breakfast that was included w/ the room. I will most definitely go back! Rach',\n 'The hotel is near to the central park. It has a great service and the employees always are attentive. The price is ok according to the quality. I recommend to travel to Antigua, Guatemala and to this hotel.',\n 'We (couple, 40 & 50 years old) stayed at Posada Don Valentino for one night in November 2013 and paid about $40 a night.  Our room was small but clean.  The bathroom was also small but clean; the water was hot.  There was a room safe and cable television.  The hotel is quiet and has a kitchen and salon.  It is about four blocks from Parque Central and one block from the market.  We stayed in four Antigua hotels over five nights and this was the best one for the price.',\n \"This place is run-down, dirty in places, and it's apparent that the ownership lacks the incentive to invest in new things to update an old property.  In our first room, both the TV and shower were broken.  They brought in old sets until one barely worked.    The worst part is that we requested the wake-up call for a morning shuttle to the airport 3 times, because they seemed arrogant and confused.  They didn't wake-us up!  This is the first time this has ever happened to me.  When I told the front office person, she told me to write complaint forms and it wasn't her fault because it was in a book that she showed me.  She did seem upset, but this is a process that should work within any hotel.    On a minor note, the rooms are over-priced for what you get by Antigua standards. \",\n 'Great location right near la Merced church which was the centre for many of the Easter festivities over semana Santa which was just amazing. Small and intimate hotel, made friends easily with the other guests. The staff were very helpful, overall enjoyed my stay. ',\n \"I stayed 1 night on my way back to Guatemala City, the room was comfortable and clean and I was lucky enough to have a room with a view of the rooftops.  There are only 9 rooms or so and it looks like most of them don't have any natural light as they look onto an internal courtyard and stairwell.  The lone guy working on reception was very good, despite his lack of English he was really helpful.\",\n 'We just stayed in Posada San Vincente for 1 night on our way between Guatemala City and Lago Atitlan. We arrived pretty late but they were great. Got us checked in quickly. Room was basic, but clean and had everything we needed. Quiet too! In the morning we spent some time on the rooftop patio, which is gorgeous. Would be a great place to chill in the daytime. Free coffee, tea and water available, and good internet access.   They also arranged our airport pickup from Guatemala City - everything went smoothly.',\n 'The hotel is pretty, very centrally located,  and the roof terrace was nice for reading.  Staff seemed fine and we were able to store our bags after checking out.   Room was big - we had a single and double bed - and free reliable wifi.  However,  our shower was terrible and flooded our room. Our room was close to what I think was a staff room, and staff were very loud during the day and early in the morning. Also, there were quite a few children playing outside our room throughout our stay.   It was fine,  but we stayed in nicer and cheaper hotels in Antigua.  ',\n 'Close to the central square in the old town, nice garden area on the ground floor and a roof top patio area where you can relax. We were able to leave our big bags here as we moved around on excursions. Kitchen available for shared use. Travel agent next door and a supermarket 1 and a half blocks away at 5a Calle Poniente.',\n 'Pros Friendly staff Easy check in Clean room Safe  Laundry service  Charming  Good location  Secure at night  Roof top   Cons Very very noisy court yard  Small rooms Hot water in shower inconsistent (only mentioning because it can get quite cold in Antigua). ',\n 'We started our holiday at hotel Posada san vincente. A great place, clean rooms and helpful staff.   The rooms are a bit noisy. But the location (close to the central parc) and the lovely courtyard makes up for it.',\n \"Great front staff-helpful for setting up excursions/transportation.   Front staff spoke Engliish during the day.  The door was locked at night and you had to knock to get in.  Room clean.  Clean water for drinking and filling water bottles.  Perfect location.  No AC but didn't need.  Great views on balcony.  There is a rooster close by, so can be a little noisy.\",\n \"Stayed here with a group of 10 for one night before heading out to the airport in Guatemala City. The price was great and the staff was friendly and helpful but it's definitely a no-frills kind of place. The shower in one of our rooms was broken, but quickly repaired, though water pressure was still pretty awful. We were on the first floor and it was very noisy at night; not sure if it was staff, fellow guests or street noise. Staff helped us arrange very affordable airport transportation and the free WiFi was pretty strong for Guatemala. It's a good, safe place for a quick stay for those on a budget, but for ~$15 more per night per person, there are much nicer options in Antigua.\",\n 'Room was small.  Bathroom small.  Sparce.  Reasonably clean.  Rock hard mattresses and pillows.  Some of the staff remarkably reserved, almost surly.  Others very friendly.  (These people see a lot of difficult foreigners and could easily get jaded.)  We came to Antigua from a week in a rental house at Atitlan.  The return to one small hotel room could bias my perception of it.  It was not anything special for the price we paid.  We had reserved ahead of time because I had my wife and two youngest daughters and did not want to be looking for a place with them in tow.  I am sure we could have secured a much better price if we had negotiated it upon arrival.',\n \"Staff is very friendly and helpful. Wifi works well.  My friends first floor room intensly smelled like moth balls. Since there is only a small window facing the interior patio, the smell cannot be eliminated. Yikes. I stayed on the 2nd Floor and the smell was not so detectable.  Any noise echoes in the interior of the hotel, so be aware. It's like that in most colonial hotels. I found it a bad value for the money $35/night. No coffee or food available. There are better alternatives in Antigua for less money, like the Juma Ocag, a lovely place.\",\n 'Clean, spacious rooms. Friendly staff. Just two blocks form the plaza (center of town). Although there is no noise isolation, it is rather quite at night, which means a night good sleep. Kitchenette available.',\n 'I stayed at a few hostels in Antigua and this is fine the main issue of noise from the courtyard. 3 people talking sounds like a party in the room! The breakfast is okay just a bit slow. The wifi could be improved as well',\n 'The hostel staff are great and are always willing to help with requests, booking tours and shuttles etc. I would strongly recommend that you book the Acatenango hike through the hostel as it is proved to be professionally done. There is free water and coffee 24/7 and a nice few communal areas as well as a fully functioning kitchen and bar. The rooms are large and have plenty of storage space and the beds all have an individual light and are comfortable.',\n \"We had a pleasant stay here because of the following: Very comfortable beds and good night's sleep. Attractive communal areas including a pretty garden. Good breakfast included that you can enjoy every morning in said garden. Generally happy and pleasant staff. Good security measures with the front entrance having a friendly young lad on the door evenings/early mornings. Erm... Guess that's it... Quite a few good things though, eh?\",\n 'This is a basic clean hostel with shared bathrooms. Our room was a basic room which was clean and comfortable.There was a reasonable breakfast and a nice garden to eat breakfast. The location was very good and it had  good wifi. There is good night security. Shop around for travel deals and laundry as they are slightly more expensive than other places nearby.',\n \"on first look Jacaranda doesnt look like much as the rooms are quite basic. but the place is really clean - there were always cleaners around- and the price is great especially when you consider that a freshly made breakfast is included. its also got very good security throughout the night which is important in Antigua. the showers take a while to heat up but if you persevere you can get hot water! its good for couples or people travelling not looking to socialise, although if you're looking for a hostel vibe i wouldn't recommend it.\",\n 'I was a bit late in organising accom for my arrival in Guatemala so was going in blind. However, I have no regrets.  Lucy on front desk is great with perfect English. The hostel is clean and basic and seems to attract a very chilled vibe as opposed to other more party hostels.  Breakfast is great also.',\n 'I stayed a couple of nights in this hostel at the beginning of my trip in Guatemala, and decided to stop there again before leaving the country. It is a quiet place and the staff was always very nice and helpful. I had a small single room (maybe the illumination can be improved) and the shared bathroom was clean and comfortable. In the morning you can choose among a few types of breakfast, which was good. There is a nice garden in the back of the hostel.',\n 'Lovely courtyard where you can relax have a drink and sit in the sun. Rooms fairly basic but nice enough. Hot water nice views from rooftop. Pretty decor resembling some spanish heritage. Rooms large. Only annoying thing is that you have to knock or rung the bell whenever you want to get into the hotel which means we were woken up late and early as you can hear it in your room.pick a room on a higher floor on the other side of the courtyard ',\n 'I stayed here recently for a few nights. The location is good, just four blocks away from the main plaza. The courtyard area and rooftop are nice and the rooms were spacious and clean. You need to leave the shower running for a good five minutes before it starts to warm up though! The breakfasts were nice and reasonably priced. Staff were also friendly but didn’t understand much English. WiFi worked quite well. Overall decent enough hotel.',\n 'Quiet hotel, with very nice accomodation! People is very knid and always willing to satisfy the client. Breakfast on the roof is very good, with an excellent view on the city and mountains! However, bad smell in the bathroom (but which can be easily fixed)',\n 'This place looks not much from the outside, but when you enter it has a beautiful centre courtyard.  All the rooms come off the centre, it can be noisy if there are people in the courtyard as the noise travels upwards.  If you have room backing onto the road, this can too be noisy with local traffic on the cobbled roads.  Breakfast is on the roof with a great view to volcanoes, which you can see them puffing smoke.  Close location to the centre of town, with good restaurants also close by.',\n 'This hotel is located an easy 10 minute walk from the city center which makes it a nice quiet place from traffic. The view from the roof of the hotel where you have breakfast is fantastic. You can choose from a menu which free breakfast you would like. I ordered pancakes one morning that came with 2 pancakes, 3 different fruit slices, yogurt and granola, it was fantastic!  The staff are very pleasant and helpful, most also speak excellent English especially the desk staff.  I agree with other reviewers regarding hearing everything in your room so if guests are holding conversations at 3 in the morning as they are leaving you can hear everything. You would think that the guests themselves would understand the need to be quiet when they are in the courtyard at night.',\n \"Stayed here to attend a friend's wedding in a chapel in town. This is a charming hotel, walking distance from everything, great breakfast, quiet and has a great rooftop view while you eat. The staff was very nice and attentive and Antigua is simply beautiful.\",\n 'i recently lead a group of 13 to Antigua and Panajachel. the tour company booked us into this hotel. it was very convenient - 2 blocks from Plaza Central w/ several restaurants and small cafes nearby. the interior of the hotel is like an antique store - all sorts of older chairs, telephones, furniture, typewriters here and there. rooms ranged from small [one queen bed w/ two armoires and desk] to spacious [two queen beds, etc]. wifi was available at no charge - good signal. Luis and staff were excellent - friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. no breakfasts but two small cafes nearby.  if you can deal w/ an older place but great staff, San Sebastian is a great choice.',\n 'The grounds are spectacular. I loved the energy of the property. Overall the staff was quite accommodating. Make sure that when you are booking a room that you specify which room type you are requesting. The food was very good. I wish there were more choices for gluten free. ',\n 'Tiny and old rooms (we booked a double room). Almost no light, just like a cave. However the room was clean. The bed was not good so it was difficult to rest properly. On the other side the bathroom was good comparing to the room itself.  No breakfast included and there is no restaurant in the hostal. Anyway there is a kitchen for the guests.  Location was good, few steps from the Parque Central. We booked private shuttle from the airport. They charge an additional fee of Q50 per every hour your flight is delayed. They warn about that when you book the shuttle and it is supposed to pay the additional hour of parking in the airport. Once we took the shuttle we didnt see the driver paying anything and passing any parking barrier, so I wonder if those 50Q are really a fraud. Just',\n \"First things first: the dorms have no supporting furniture whatsoever, just the tiny locker... there is no space for nothing, all is crammed... we are talking about twelve persons and all their personal belongings. A mess.   The bathroom is cleaned once a day, not enough, again, when we are talking about 12 persons using it... when I arrived, just before cleaning, the rubbish bin was full - not a nice thing to see or smell - and on top of that there was no toilette paper (fortunately I noticed that in advance).  Common space is limited to a sterile rooftop with three tables and two sunbeds. Kitchen is also in the rooftop. Now imagine... it's raining or windy and cold... no place to be except in the awfully crowded and messy dorm. And access to the  kitchen will be for the braves\",\n 'We spent a weekend in Antigua, and this hotel was very good.  I have stayed in Antigua several times before and this is the closest I have stayed to the central plaza, and is very convenient if you are traveling alone is safe to walk at any time to the plaza and then come back.  The staff was outstanding, so kind and helpful and the hotel had a nice pool and good rooms.  I liked it a lot.  The price was also very reasonable.',\n 'I stayed here in May with a group volunteering with Safe Passage. I was very happy with my second floor room (#7) and even though there is a loud bar next door I was able to muffle the noise with the room fan and my white noise machine. The room was cleaned promptly and well each day and staff were polite, even when - due to a reservation glitch - we needed to be moved out of the hotel a day early. Staff helped me move my luggage to a sister property down the street. Breakfast was good also.',\n \"If you want to spend some time like if you were at some relative's home, to feel yourself welcome and well attended in a cozy ambiance, this is the place. My family and I have spent some quality moments there, and we have nothing to regret. The owners will treat you like you would treat an old friend. You can enjoy the silence of the country if you want to rest and if you want to go to a bar or a restaurant and socialize with others, within a few minutes you can get to Antigua. Hope to get back soon.\",\n \"After a few nights' stay at El Hostal earlier in our trip, we were really happy we decided to try Posada Don Valentino for our 2nd stage in Antigua. There's a lot more happening at this end of town, more places to eat, it's close to the parque central (central park). Plus the posada is very quiet, offering an excellent night's stay. The staff were very friendly and polite.   The only two minor issues were with the water (somewhat difficult to regulate the shower temperature, although we had the same issue at most of the places we stayed, but for this slightly pricier place, we expected a bit better) and the two rooms we got were rather dark (however, this seems to be typical in Antigua and indeed throughout Guatemala).  Note that a pool is advertised but it's in another property\",\n \"I have made the Don Valentino my home in Antigua on 3 occasions, one was for a week, Other stops were for 2 days. Many positives: English speaking staff, all lovely ladies. The location is the best: Out the door, turn right, for a large grocery, just doors away. Another block to the big market.    A short walk the other way to an ATM, the Central Park, and a place we love for morning coffee, The Bagel Barn, a big gringo gathering spot because of good wifi. A block from the Park is Mono Loco, another gringo favorite because you can watch any sporting event. If it's televised anywhere they have it.   Across the street from the Don Valentino is one of my favorite restaurants, La Pena de Sol Latino. Great food, reasonable prices. The owner is an ex pat from Nashville.      The hotel\",\n \"We didn't stay here but stopped here a couple of times -- first, for directions, and second, because the staff were so helpful and friendly and we used the internet service, and had tea and coffee.  It looks like a sweet place to stay, with clean and handsome interiors and a beautiful, flower-filled interior courtyard.  The staff we met were very kind and attentive.\",\n '\"See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don\\'t know how to \\'hold\\' the reservation and that\\'s really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.\" Seinfeld  I have lived in Guatemala for three years and have enjoyed many trips to different hotels, hostels and resorts during my time here.  All have been pleasant or at least adventurous.  In fact...I need to write reviews for all of my positive stays.  This hotel made me sad.  They hotel took my request for a room.  I confirmed.  Three days later I received an email saying they were sorry but they had given my room to a larger group.  Interesting.  I guess I expected something more then an excuse from them but in the end that is what I got.  I was never offered a real apology just',\n 'The friendly lady at the reception ensures that the guests are comfortable: from breakfast till organizing tours and farewell. The patio is a rustic place to relax and the rooms have a comfortable, romantic atmosphere.',\n 'The hotel is very inexpensive and our room was very clean.  The courtyard was very beautiful and was perfect for coffee in the morning.  The location is very good since it is close to the city center. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.   It is perfect for a quick weekend trip, but I would not recommend for extended stays.  There is nothing special about the rooms and all.',\n 'I totally enjoyed my stay at Posada Dona Luisa. Reasonable rates, clean nice rooms good view of the volcano...Couple blocks from the main square.The hotel is safe and has locked doors at all times.  The shower needs a facelift for sure. The staff was friendly and helpful in every way...I would recommend coming here if you want to save money and be able to walk into town to enjoy beautiful Antigua.',\n 'For a lot of old hippies, to get a clean shower, a decent bed, and get off the street would have been paradise.  Cramped quarters, clean, sheets and fresh coffee, INSTANT in a land known for his roasting and grinding..it´s good for those seeking adventure.  A bummer you have to pay $7.50 USD a night to park your car 3 blocks away. It is less than 4 blocks to the big center of town where the Indian venders come to see you everything, including cell phones they stole from someone the day before.',\n 'We had a great stay here and at 3 other hotels under the same chain (long story). At each place, we negotiated a rate of 25 a night which didnt include breakfadt but gave us access to good clean kitchens, wifi (except on hotel) and very lovely staff. These hotels are easy places to stay for a good price. Get involved!',\n 'Very typical Posada, great location, conveniently close to everything, very friendly staff, good service, clean basic rooms... My recommendation is to avoid Room # 1 by all means, it is literally right by the reception area (3 steps), and so can be extremely noisy! Other than that, I would recommend!',\n \"Their customer service is really really bad. Unfriendly and seemingly uninterested to make their customers happy. The beautiful yard is sprayed with pesticides which stinks for hours (even smelled it the next day...)  They made a mistake with our booking and skipped a day (so they wanted us to leave for one night and return the next day). We wanted our money back instead as we didn't want to move every day. but for over 1 hour they refused to do so. The owner lives in the US and apparently failed to give any staff member the power to 'change the policies re 3 day cancellation period' or the memo that making their customers happy will make them return. We will not.\",\n \"This place has horrendous customer service, old mattress that you can feel all of the springs in, it is super loud and the workers wake you up first thing in the morning as their chatter echoes through the whole hotel. And don't think you can book in and cancel later because you hate  it because they will still charge you the FULL price to cancel your room. There are so many wonderful places to stay in Antigua, this place isn't worth your time or money.\",\n 'Nice place close to central park. We just walked in and asked for a room they gave to us for 280q. For somthing equal to this normaly would be 400q. Id say average size rooms with hot water.pillows a bit hard. The plants and decor was nice and dont forget to lounge in the sun on the roof and take a photo with the volcano in the background.we found cheaper hotelsfor 200q but they were not nice., more like a hostal and one said hot water when i looked in shower there was a sign saying to ask for hot water and they leave a bucket outside your door lol. ',\n 'Good location, everything Else average! The rooms are basic and the hotel is cute But nothing Fancy. Service wise We had the best and the worst, the people working there are polite and helpful But We didnt like that they charge you extra for paying with crédit cards! And CAREFUL with doing your laundry here !!! They ruined some of clothes! They stained them blue despite the fact that We separated the clothes! ',\n 'My stay at three monkeys was okay, but I would not stay here again. On a positive note it’s in an excellent location, very close to many restaurants and bars, the people staying and working there were great, and the onsite bar was cheap! So if you love to party it’s a good place to stay.  However the beds are uncomfortable and have bed bugs, the showers only have hot water at a pressure so low it’s like a sad trickle of a bucket, and the tours booked through the hostel were sub-par. The hostel tours consistently ran 30mins - 1 hour late and crammed so many people onto a bus it was like a chicken bus for tourists. There are heaps of tour companies around Antigua so I would recommend shopping around.',\n 'A cool little hostel in a good location. Aesthetically ticks the box, cute garden area, hammocks, cool lighting. Felt trendy and definitely frequented by the ‘younger’ traveller / gap years etc Basic bedrooms, reasonably comfortable, a little loud at night but couldn’t complain for the price. It did the job for a one night stop gap and the staff we did meet were really friendly. ',\n 'We loved the hostel! We felt very comfy since the moment we got there. We (2 females) slept in a shared room of 4 (2 bunk beds) with private bathroom, it was spacious. It could be a bit cleaner though, especially the bathroom. It has a bar and hammocks to chill!',\n 'Stayed at Jacaranda for one night before going to Lake Atitlan. Stayed in a private room with shared bathroom, which was okay. Clean rooms and bathrooms. Breakfast was nice and included. Staff is helpful with shuttleservices. Located near the main avenue',\n 'I had a great time in Casa Jacaranda! The garden is an amazing place to just sit read a book and relax! One of the best thing about this place was the included breakfast and the kitchen they have for the guests! The bathroom were always clean and the bedroom too.   One bad thing is that they dont have outlets at the dorms but you can charge your stuff at the kitchen or somewhere else.  The staff was always willing to help with a smile and kindness! ',\n \"When I arrived here the hostel felt a bit weird, because of the man that showed me the place did everything very quick and didn't really explain. It was very dark everywhere and annoying western music. But then I saw the garden in the back, the clean and comfortable bathroom and my private room was nice as well, so at the end it was good. Not a really social place and a bit outside the centre, but in front of la Merced you can eat really good food at night and it's safe to walk there alone!\",\n \"Quiet south side of town, around the corner from deluxe hotels, just a few blocks to Parque Central. Sunny rooms along tiled walkways surround lush garden with plashing fountain (muted at night). Great deal! I stayed 16 days, each morning checking out the weather & taking in views of Vulcán de Agua and puffing Volcán de Fuego from the rooftop terrace. Complimentary coffee & drinking water. Optional breakfast was decent, served alfresco & only a little more than you'd pay in a typical cafe. Abundant in-room storage.\",\n 'The staff at this hotel are extremely pleasant and courteous.  They do speak enough English to communicate.   The rooftop terrace is excellent for viewing the volcano and nearby hills over the town.  The grounds are well kept with nice flowers and landscaping.   We enjoyed the walk to parqué central just 4 blocks away.  We will not stay here again due to a small number of mosquitos in the room and the head-ache-inducing odour of insecticides on about half of the property.  We were pleased however that our room was changed to a less smelly insecticide room.  Finally,  they told us they would accept Quetzals or US cash.  We tried to pay with $100 US.  Staff said they could not do so because they did not have enough change in Quetzals or USD$.  Rate was 7.5 to 1 if they had.  Later',\n \"This hotel would be so nice, if it weren't so noisy.

We had booked a room in advance, because our arrival was quite late, and paid 48 dollars for it. The staff was very friendly, the patio and roof terrace beautiful and the location very central.

I thought that it was possible tot have  breakfast at the hotel itself (for a few dollars), but no, it was served in another hotel (same owner), a few blocks away.

It is located at the end of a street, at the edge of the city center, making the back and forth from the center not so enjoyable (polution from cars and busses and uneaven pavement). Breakfast is poor. Very noisy from cars and other guests. Internet signal is good, but only near reception. Shower is OK but water gets cold and super hot while you shower.  Luxurius or mid-range category is overstated. For $100 they charge you can get much better hotels max 2 blocks from the central square. They all have the charming colonial style. I will not stay at this hotel again and do not recommend it, but staff were super kind and attentive.',\n \"Didn't like the dorms here at all. 3 bunk beds squeezed into a 2.5x3meter shoe box. Thank goodness we were the only ones in the dorm otherwise you would not even be able to open the door without knocking the other people in the room. The safe boxes in the dorms only fit passports and otter small gadgets. I did not like the bathrooms either - they smelled stuffy and stale and i actually chose to not shower when we stayed there. The communal kitchen was barely useable. Breakfast i must say was the highlight of our very short stay there.

It was fine but not really amazing in any respect.  Positives: - Really helpful staff who speak good English - Good security - Lovely breakfast - Good range of tours available through the hostel, and prices which are quite good  Improvements: - Since the Lonely Planet review they seemed to have added extra dorm beds to the already-small dorms.  Ours had six, crammed into a very small space. - Some of the toilets/showers are in outside cubicles.  In some respects this is nice, but it means there can be a few more mosquitoes lurking about.',\n 'Clean hostel with beautiful gardens.

The booking was recorded as one person and not two, although the room booked was correct with twin beds.  However, they insisted on charging another $10 on arrival as the booking was incorrect on their system. Why one person would request twin beds, I don't know.

We were surprised upon checking in to see the quality of the room, considering we were paying 250 q which in this price range has been giving us modest but nice accommodation in our travels in Guatemala .

We walked into one of the hotels which turned out to be in a some kind of an Antiguan hotel network with Don Valentino - this first place did not have spare rooms but they refered us to Don Valention round the corner.  Don Valentino is nice and clean, though our room was quite tiny. And surprisingly it was also quite pricey as most of the hotels and restaurants in Antigua seem to be.

The underground parking lot is a bit far away and hard to enter when you get there for the first time.  The guards were nice however it was hard to find my villa and had to walk a lot to find it. It had all that I needed, however the fridge was a bit noisy and couldn’t use the internet at all (the password never worked)  The pool looked nice but crowded so maybe too small for the quantity of the villas.

It was extremely quite and they had a list of rules posted up around the hostel. You even have to pay to use the telephone and there is ZERO noise after 11. If you want to interact with fellow backpackers do not stay here. If you want peace and quite and to go straight to bed then this is your place. It just depends what you are looking for.

Posada Don Valentino is a fine mid-priced hotel 2 blocks from the market, and close to Parque Central.  The room was clean and had a large window to the upstairs patio.

The best thing about Posada Don Valentino is that for only $5/day, you can use the pool and jacuzzi at Hotel Casa del Parque. Otherwise, the rooms are basic and clean, but nothing near what you would expect for the prices charged. There is no free wireless, which is astounding as  nearly every hotel and restaurant in Antigua offers this service.

At first we loved the place as it is beautiful and the people staying were really nice. But after a while we started to notice and heard many stories about the owner/manager screwing people over with their rent amount, charging extra for no reason and being really mean to people to basically scare them out of the house. This had never effected us personally until near the end of our stay. We had a night out where we came home and made a tiny bit of noise (which is quite normal for people in the house as a lot of people worked at bars), for some reason she just decided to go crazy at the group of us which consisted of yelling at us for days, telling us we couldn't sit in the kitchen, shooing us out\",\n \"If you're thinking after reading Lonely Planet that this sounds like a cute place to stay, you're going to be massively disappointed. This hotel is as soulless and corporate as they come in Guatemala, and is absurdly overpriced for what you get.

The shower is absolutely pathetic. The only way to get hot water is to have the water flow at the bare minimum. Every other hotel I stayed at in Guatemala (and all of which were CHEAPER than this dump) had legitimate hot water.   But most egregiously, this is hands down the loudest hotel I've ever stayed in.

I always prearranged my airport transfer upon arrival to a country I visit for convenience and safety. The reception employees at day time were very helpful and they spoke English well.

It's a comfortable and cozy kind of place, hidden from the street. Our room was a budget one, nicely decorated and along the main corridor. It was a bit noisy at night with guests coming and going, so if you stay ask for a room around the courtyard or the great little apartment up on the roof. There is a kitchen here as well as a comfortable lounge room.

The hotel is a small house, which is part of the bigger Porta Hotel, so you get access to a lot of their services like breakfast buffet, pool, spa, etc. The nice thing about the hotel is that it is very private (I think only 10 rooms), so it's definitely very quiet, so you get to relax. The rooms are clean and nicely designed. The hotel could use a little bit of work in some areas, but nothing major. It is also very conveniently located and never a far walk from all the cool spots. The only reason I don't give the hotel 5 stars is because I think the staff could have been more welcoming and friendlier.\",\n \"We had a good stay at the Casa Encantada, which we got to from hotel Porta Antigua (they had no rooms available and suggested their sister hotel). We were promised to have access to all of Porta Antigua facilities - including the buffet breakfast.

Would be happy to go back',\n 'The room where we stayed at was close to the street and you could hear the cars passing by, it was loud.  The beds in the room were comfortable, however there were hairs in one of them. We took them out but that wasn\\'t nice. The TV worked but there wasn\\'t any signal, it seemed as if there wasn\\'t a cable service yet. If you\\'re traveling in a car there isn\\'t parking so you need to park in a street next to the suites and you have to pay Q50 for a guy to come and \"watch\" the car, during the night I went to check the car 2 times and never saw that guy. The hotel isn\\'t finished yet so you can\\'t have breakfast there. The rooms are spacious and comfortable to spend a couple of nights, you have hot water and a private bathroom which is always good.  ',\n \"Stayed here on 2 occasions. We stayed in different rooms, one on the first floor and again on the second floor. Seems to be OK for a budget/short stay. Very pretty inside the courtyard but all noise echoes through to the rooms. Not sure what it is about the beds but they seem to squeak which makes for a noisy sleep. There's somebody on reception most times of the day & night which was helpful. However one night we had to ask the reception staff to keep the noise down at 1am in the morning, they were chatting & playong music quite loudly.\",\n \"Frankly I felt that this place had opened before it was ready.  Complete lack of signage making it a stealth hostel, the first room i was assigned the handle came off in my hand, the second had a TV with no remote placed 9 feet up on the wall so as to be unusable. Bathroom was functional and there was hot water, so it's not a complete disaster, but I was pretty unimpressed.\",\n 'The luscious tropical courtyards are tranquil and filled with interesting and well tended plant life. This is a true oasis that boasts art and delicious food as well.  We went for a jacuzzi room upgrade and we wouldn’t repeat the floor level tub, but we did love the private balcony, fireplace and cathedral ceiling.  It should be 5 stars but 1 hand towel, no wash cloths and a slow draining sink 2 days after reporting  it keeps it from the rating it should have in every other respect.',\n \"I enjoyed my night at San Jorge Hotel.  I had just 24 hrs to visit Antigua and wanted a quick overnight getaway.  I decided to stay a few blocks away from the main square ... quiet and convenient.  The hotel is very comfortable and clean. I stayed in a double room with two large beds, a bathroom with full bath, TV with cable, closet, fireplace, etc. The garden is beautiful and there's a very picturesque view of the volcano behind the hotel. The continental breakfast was delicious, the staff are helpful, and I felt safe as a single female traveler.  I would definitely stay here again.\",\n \"Fabulous place for the adventure traveler type. Very friendly and helpful staff.  Always offering coffee.  Very good complimentary breakfast.

Only drawback for me was lack of really hot shower..water only got to lukewarm during my stay  \",\n \"We moved to this hotel on our last night in Antigua, since the entire city was full due to upcoming festivities. We were coming from a much fancier hotel, so we were prepared for something pretty basic. Staff warned us beforehand that our room was very small and dark, but it was actually quite adequate.  Furnishings were attractive and though the room was very tiny, it was clean and functional.  Our ensuite bathroom was simple and basic (toilet, sink and very weak shower) but clean and adequate.  There was no tv, but you could see where there used to be one mounted on the ceiling! We didn't care about a tv, but I guess some people might. Our window looked out into a hall and there was a warning next to the door not to leave valuables in sight. When the lights were on, you could\",\n 'Dear sirs.

There is a  terraces with nice flowers to sit and read. But the key is the wonderful help of Susy, Leidy and Avry at the front desk. They went way beyond there duty to help in finding us other hotels, using their computer, in other towns, transportation, what do do etc. Nicholas and Joyce',\n \"I stayed for 2 nights and they tried to charge me for 4 nights! Actually they did charge me for 4 nights claiming there was confusion because I had cancelled a prior reservation and rebooked. They actually said I reserved and cancelled twice. Either way they admitted there was only one reservation in the end, so still don't understand why they would charge me for 4 nights and not say anything, especially when I asked the night prior to early checkout if everything was OK. The clerk was very condescending and refused to refund me in full the extra amount. Ended up having to dispute with my credit card company when I returned home. So beware! Otherwise location and common areas are good, breakfast average and my room was dark and had a musty smell. I woul not stay here again if it\",\n \"My girlfriend and I stayed in Room #1 for 3 nights. The hotel is beautiful. The staff is friendly and bilingual. The free breakfast is also pretty good. Unfortunately, our experience was less than satisfactory.   We were woken up each of the 3 mornings between 6:30-7:30am to extremely loud sounds coming from the second floor. Above our room is the terrace. Each morning it sounded like furniture being moved. The noise lasted 20-40 minutes and it was LOUD.  It made it impossible to sleep, even over our two bedroom fan phone apps. We complained to the receptionist the second morning, but it didn't help. The noise continued that morning and the next.   Also, our toilet ran constantly, the sink faucet never got hot, didn't drain properly and had really loose handles.

There was some damp on the walls but the water was hot and constant.  Both the hostel and the room were safe and clean. Good security and constantly-cleaning housekeeping staff. All of the staff are friendly but mostly keep to themselves.   The room I had was a good size and although I was told I had a brand new bed it was one of the most uncomfortable beds I have slept on. The pillows are terrible too .. almost non-existent. There is occasional noise at night\",\n \"Lovely place, tiny dorm room but big lockers outside the room which helps. Clean, well equipped kitchen and free water. Close to the centre and several restaurants.

Once inside the rooms there is no noise so a quiet sleep can be had.  The rooms are clean however lack ventilation and suffer from mild damp issues so they may seem a little musty....we overcome this by sleeping with window open and the fan on.  The kitchen is well equipped and very clean with a lovely roof trace next to it....a great place to chill on the sun loungers in the afternoon heat.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  They also give free drinking water, tea and coffee.  Lovely little getaway.',\n 'An okay place to stay in fairly expensive Antigua.  No frills but in safe area close to centre of town.  friendly owner. very small room with no outside window, only window opening with no glass to interior hallway.  much more of a hostel than a hotel.',\n \"Four of my friends and I stayed at the San Sebastian our first and last nights in Guatemala.  The location is great -- about 2 blocks from the main square, and just around the corner from Dona Luisa's bakery, a terrific bakery and restaurant.  The owner Luis was very helpful and we even had use of the kitchen.  Each room was like a museum, with ornate furniture and decorations.  The rooftop terrace gave us 360 degree views of Antigua.  This isn't a luxury hotel, it is wonderful and funky and we felt safe and comfortable here.\",\n 'So pretty place. Fantastic furniture, enviroment. Our room was wide, with a private bathroom. Big jacuzzi, hot water (rare in Guatemala). The best memory i bring with my self is the polite and kindness of Luis, the owner.

And the price is not bad!',\n 'This posada is an amazing two blocks from the Parque Central--making it a short walk to everything. The miracle is that at night, you cannot hear traffic or street noise.  THe décor is funky--lots of old art, crucifixes, sculptures and paintings all over. The beds are comfortable enough and there is plenty of hot water. They do not serve breakfast but within a block in any direction there are many breakfast options.  Luis--who I think is the owner--is a warm and welcoming man. He truly tries to make guests feel at home here. I could imagine becoming true friends with him, if there was more time, as I think many guests do.  I stayed here for a couple of days on two separate occasions in March. My only complaint is that groups of young students were also here and making',\n 'We enjoyed our 6 night stay here last week. The walls are paper thin and you pretty much hear everything but it quietens down in the late evening. Nice kitchen and the beds were ok nothing special. It is a very pretty setting and the location is good. I have never stayed in a cleaner place. The whole place was thoroughly cleaned and inspected every day.',\n 'The hotel has a green, welcoming yard but the rooms are dark and the whole place is pretty noisy, due to the thin windows (you can NOT actually close them entirely) and the owner s family who wakes up at 5:30 AM every morning. Also, avoid the rooms by the laundry at any price (VERY noisy). And don\\'t let the hotel get you a cab from the Airport : their service is 12$ more expensive than the airport \"safe\" cabs. Still it´s a clean, convenient place to stay.',\n 'We really enjoyed our stay here.  The location is fantastic for the price.  The roof top has a beautiful view of the volcanoes and sunset.  The rooms are basic, but good for the location.  The staff mainly speaks spanish, so not as helpful as I would have liked when recommending a restaurant.  My only major complaint is the shuttle company that they arranged our transportation through from Antigua to Pana.  The driver was pretty rude and he dropped us off far from the public pier and lead us into the hands of \"helpful\" boat drivers, who took us and our luggage to a private dock and attempted to have us pay 20-30 dollars for a ride to santa cruz, instead of 2.50.  We figured this out and lugged our bags to the public dock.  It was a very uncomfortable and unpleasant situation. ',\n \"We stayed here with our two young children. The hotel has a beautiful area in the center with lots of plants and a fountain. Rooms were simple and clean. We would definitely stay again when we go to Antigua. Don't forget the awesome rooftop patio! Muy bien!\",\n \"Spent 6 nights in June for the purposes of attending a relative's wedding.  Hotel staff was very accommodating to configure the rooms to fit our multiple family groups.  The property has lots of charm as all rooms open to a courtyard with lots of greenery and a fountain.  The property is older but very clean, and the staff spent lots of time keeping it that way.  Great location and volcano views from the rooftop balcony.  We walked almost everywhere in main part of Antigua from this hotel.  Hotel offers 24 x 7 tea and coffee as well as filtered water that we used daily to fill our bottles.  They also sell beer/soda at reasonable prices.  We did not pay extra for the breakfast, choosing to eat in the town, but from what I saw it seemed more than adequate.  There is also a common\",\n 'Beautiful hotel in an old monastery. The place is magical and breakfast spectacular.

The bathrooms had hot water in the shower once we figured out how to turn it on.\",\n \"We really enjoyed this quaint hotel! The location is great - just steps away from the city center. The atmosphere and decor were spot on. Our favorite part was the cakes and coffees served each night. The only issue was the hot chocolate that was served at night. The hotel was full but there was only one pitcher which ran out quickly! My children requested it at breakfast one day, but were told they wouldn't have any until the evening! It was delicious and we just wish there was more!! The rooms were a nice size and the lounge areas around the hotel were plentiful and relaxing. It was nice watching the lava coming from the volcano at night from the roof top deck! \",\n \"I stayed 2 nights at the Hotel San Jorge. Like all of Antigua, it looks like a fortress from the outside, but the door opens to a lovely garden and fountain-a welcomed respite from the cobblestones and pollution of the city.  The complementary breakfast is fresh and more than adequate to get you on your way. The garden is a nice spot to read or catch some sun. The safe was not working in the first room I was assigned to, so I was switched to another, which was roomy and adequate. My only complaint was no hot water on the 3rd morning of my stay. When I inquired about this, I was told  they were aware of it and were waiting for the repair man, but I was gone before knowing when and if he arrived.

While this hotel is not luxurious, the staff - especially Evelyn Herrera - were extremely helpful.   The free breakfast of, juice, tea/coffee, fruit, toast, local jam, yogurt and homemade granola was plentiful and very tasty. Spanish lessons can be arranged.   This hotel is conveniently located near the primary square and within walking distance of all the major markets/shops.',\n 'We stayed in a double room at Hostal Antigua, which was fine. The room was a little on the small side for two people but was OK for the price and had a decent en suite. The complimentary purified water was a nice touch and the staff were pretty good.

What we enjoyed most was the breakfast area up on the roof.  Delicious fresh fruit juices and jams and a variety of things to choose from for breakfast.  The views of the volcanos and the flowers in the garden down below are priceless!  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The pool is very small and with the cool temperatures in Antigua, we never really felt like jumping in.  The internet was very good, fast enough to stream movies.  The worst part was the noise from the street at night.  I didn't pack ear plugs but I wish I had.\",\n \"This was a great place to call home for a few days. The only things I would note are: the front rooms are noisy all night because its on a main street that trucks and buses go through quite often; there is only one person working most of the time, so don't expect a huge staff. Otherwise, comfortable room, bathroom and shower, nice living area and beautiful views.\",\n \"This hostal was clean, had friendly staff and the free purified water had a nice touch to the atmosphere. However, the 4-bed Dorm that I stayed in was extremely small, which meant that whenever someone woke up early to use the bathroom, he or she would wake everyone else up. If I were to go back, I'd opt for the single (although the price skyrockets from a $7 for a 4-Bed Dorm to $37 to a Single) or try to get a cheaper single in an another hostal.\",\n 'great place for the price. quiet, clean, good working facilities, and a nice little roofdeck with a decent view of the surrounding volcanoes.  we found it to be in walking distance of the main city square and most of the city, with lots of nice restaurants/bars around that area in general.

Would recommend for those on a bit of a budget, who can stand a couple of rough edges, but value a nice bit of homeliness while away.',\n \"Irma was very helpful and accommodating. Our group had a couple of special requests that she was happy to help us with. She made a wonderful breakfast each day and we had a great time practicing our spanish with a patient teacher. The hotel was clean, quiet, comfortable and near to everything we wanted to check out. As we didn't find many reviews on Booking.com we double checked on TripAdvisor and saw that it was well reviewed and we now believe those reviews were well earned. As long term lodgers we needed a bit of space to dry our clothes, especially after a wet and chilly trip up Acatenango. There wasn't a line yet but Irma assured us she was aware and was making space for one in the near future.

Then the second 'night', if we can call the first one a night, we had trouble sleeping because the owner was outside our window, in the lobby, with loud voices.

The corridors / galleries outside the first floor rooms were wide enough to hold plenty of comfortable seating, and there was even the bonus of a roof terrace overlooking the town.

That said, I saw good bones up on the higher floors and they were hauling in new mattresses while I stayed.  So much of the hotel seemed unfinished.  Outside my room was a large empty area that had potential for so much more.  I saw this also on the third floor and on the mini roof area.  If you do take the chance, ask for the third floor as the rooms up there are set back more from the road and would have a good view.  The staff did seem to be good, although I had very little communication with them.',\n 'I found myself in Antigua, quite unplanned. I stayed at Posada Don Valentino.

But the privet room had no hot water as been told and was not clean. But the thing that really was not cool was that the owner screwed us by selling us a cab to the airport. We had to be there around 6 in the morning to go to Tikal and we could take a bus at 4 in the morning for 8 dollers. But the owner told us we would not have enough time. it should take us 1:30 ours by car. So we took a cab for 40 dollar since we did not wanted to miss the plane.

The design of the walls and colors used are great and relaxing. Not a bad location, however the lady who owns the place, Blanca, doesn't wash the sheets after each person uses them. A couple of friends of mine and I were staying there and actually witnessed her and another girl, Nancy, cleaning the rooms. Blanca actually told Nancy not to change the sheets on one of the top bunks because the guy who had slept there had only stayed one night. Me and my other friends looked at each other in disgust.

I had a clean room, huge bed, but not much hot water. Breakfast on the rooftop terrace made up for the lack of hot water! It was magical!

There seemed to be only one young man at the desk the first day who spoke English. I needed a shuttle to get me to Atitlán and they couldn't help with that, but there were two travel agencies right around the corner so that wasn't a problem either. Great location and the restaurant Saberico right there!\",\n 'To say this is a moderate hotel is way over-stated.  We reserved a two bed room.  Our first reaction was being hit by the smell of mold and mildew coming from the bathroom.  There was no table, chair or anything to lay our luggage on.  The beds were against walls that were crumbling with about a 2 foot gap between the two single beds.  There was visible black mold growing in the bathroom, by the sink, shower and even on the ceiling.  The only air source was from a transom window directly onto a very noisy hallway.  Our first course of action was to ask for a different room.

It is in a great location in Antigua, right in the centre opposite the handicraft market and everything is within walking distance and on first sight this place looks beautiful and peaceful. However, as nice and clean as the rooms are, there is no privacy in this place as the walls are paper thin. You can hear everything from every room, you can hear noise from the lobby up on the third floor, and the staff do not seem to care about this. The lady on reception during the day was less than helpful, and when a member of our group asked her to turn down the loud coldplay music because one of us was trying to sleep we were rudely told no because she wanted to listen to it while having lunch with her friends in the middle of the courtyard.

The staff were extremely friendly & helpful.  The breakfast is a real positive, included in the price & you have a choice of five different menus.  I took the last remaining bed in the Casa & that happened to be a dorm bed. I don't usually opt for dorm stays as I prefer a bit of privacy.  That said, the beds were very comfortable, although the one draw back is that the dorm is too small for the three bunks in the room, as the remaining floor space does not allow for room to unpack, repack or organise your bag.  Overall, I would recommend staying here.\",\n 'Close to the market, and 10 minutes form central park.  Staff is really friendly, speak pretty good english.

The showers are NOT hot... it is luke warm at best, I hated showering because I was so cold every time. The other thing is that you hope you don't get a room by the bar because you will not be able to sleep before 11pm or so. It depends what you're looking for in a hostel but something about the vibe here was missing for me.

There's no courtesy taxi anymore as someone said in previous comments. I wouldn't advise you to walk there at night either...  - breakfast isn't great considering what you pay for the room: you get concentrated orange juice, coffee and a plate consisting of some scrambled eggs, frijoles, slice of papaya and watermelon.

Four of us stayed in a large, pretty room on the 3rd floor w/ a beautiful view of a volcano.  The other two rooms were fairly standard.  One was on the ground floor and had a window that opened onto a hallway that had quite a bit of foot traffic and so there was quite a lot of  noise.  The third room was on the 2nd floor and was a  bit bigger but also had a window that faced the stairway so there was also some noise.    The rooms were very clean, the beds were comfortable, and the staff extremely courteous.   We did a Pacaya hike through the front desk and it went smoothly.

Great location - supermarket right across the street. I like the fact it includes breakfast, which is prepared individually. A caraffe of good strong coffee included.\",\n 'The bed was comfortable, the room clean, the staff very nice and the location fantastic but the wifi was super slow, the taps in the shower in my room were installed wrong, it took 15 minutes of figuring out how to tweak it to get hot water, which was frustrating after a long day. Breakfast was supposed to be served between 7am-10am. I had a shuttle coming at 8 am, and was still waiting for food, which when finally did arrive, was a very small portion and had stale bread. Disappointing value for money in my opinion.',\n \"My wife and I enjoyed our stay during Semana Santa.  The rooms cost a little more than we expected, but this was probably due to the holidays.  Staff very helpful and friendly.  Older but very clean.  This hotel has a very nice area downstairs with tables in a shaded, plant filled, courtyard.  It also has a small kitchen for guests to use which contains a pila, refrigerator, stove, microwave, toaster oven and kitchen utensils/plates/silverware, etc.  This is useful if you don't want to eat out all the time.  Beds tend to be firm, which is what we like.  Rooms have two or three beds.  A basic budget hotel which grows on you.  We would definitely stay there again.  We are experienced travelers and have lived over six years in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Puerto Rico, and traveled in\",\n 'We stayed in many hotels during our 2 month trip, and this place was one of the bottom 3. Lot of noise during the night from the bar next door, so be aware, especially in the weekend. The staff did their best and were friendly, but limited info was available. Rooms were ok, a bit outdated, but I guess it was fair for the rate we were paying. I would not recomment this place, unless better options are fully booked.',\n 'Basic but clean hotel. Staff very helpful. Very close to the square. Avoid Saturday nights. There is a locals night club 200 ft away that plays music until 1-2 am. Bring earplugs on sat night stays. Not sure about Fridays. All other days are no problem...great place to stay.',\n 'The two guys who run this hostel are rude, arrogant and treat guests very unfairly. I am very patient and forgiving when it comes to hostels and hotels, however my patience only goes so far. I can only recommend people to look elsewhere.',\n \"This place oozes authenticity, its set around a beautiful courtyard garden and the rooms feature antiques which gives a lovely homely feel. The staff were super friendly and helpful, the rooms spacious and comfortable and it's just a short walk to everything but away from all the noise of the center. There are various hotels that match this in terms of comfort but this was definitely better value. The best part, this is called the house of dreams for good reason, the owner being someone who came here to create his dream - inspiring stuff!\",\n \"I rate this hotel low because of the poor services and rooms. When we arrived we asked the desk for two keys but were told we could only have one because they had a 24-hour receptionist to let us in the hotel and our rooms if necessary. The first night our kids were out late and when my wife and I arrived we could not get into the hotel and spent two hours waiting on the street till our kids came back and let us in. The sink and toilet were clogged and there was no one available to fix it.  The rooms have no privacy at all as all the windows face the courtyard and because of the hot weather it was very stuffy in our rooms with the windows closed.  The grounds were nice but all in all I don't recommend the hotel and would suggest another hotel in Antigua.  \",\n \"Beautiful place, great location a few blocks from Parque Central, Santo Domingo, and Las Capuchinas. Nice sized room, huge king sized bed, adequate bathroom with no water temperature or pressure issues. The grounds are gorgeous and well kept. Daily breakfast is fine if you mix it up a bit between the Desayuno Americano and the Chapina. There are three great bars on the street (Cafe No Se, La Biblioteca, and Cafe Sky) and some excellent eateries (Angie Angie, Y Tu Pina Tambien) and if you are a night owl you can party close to home. The staff's English language skills are limited but sufficient, and Monica the receptionist was outstanding in assisting us with navigating things like reserving a tour at Casa Popenoe across the street or getting us to a florist to bring a lunch gift\",\n 'I asked if they just opened and I was told no. This place is spotless. The rooms have a nice bed 2 night stands reading lamps. It has the works.  They had a special for 20US a night as well.  They also have a kitchen..also looked new that was on the roof with a view.  Also they let us keep our dogs at the hostel.....We clean up after them.  Staff was great as well.  Not a party hostel.  They need one thing drapes on the windows for the light, you can not see in the glass.  They have other hostels in town as well. I have stayed at one and it was just as nice.  Free Wifi as well.',\n \"It is a BEAUTIFUL hotel! I loved it. I came to antigua to explore my Guatemalan roots and staying in this city and hotel has definitely made me love my culture and the beauty of my dad's country. Def stay here but beware the food service is :/ ehh!\",\n 'We stayed here on our first night in Antigua, very nice friendly staff and accommodating as they checked us in early and kept our bags for few hours after check out. They also rang around for coffee tour for us and recommended tuctuc for cheaper transport.  Only downside is the funny cleaner they use on bathroom... Smells out the whole place for a while! ',\n \"My family makes the Hotel Casa del Parque  our home base in Guatemala. Super-close to the main plaza, it is classic old Antigua, vintage pavers on the ground, colorful hand-crafted tile throughout the public spaces. It is homey, not luxurious. Bathrooms are small but adequate. Breakfast is served in the dining area adjoining the pool area; it usually costs $5 US and has hot items (eggs, beans, potatoes, etc) as well as lots of fresh fruit. From the dining area you can see part of the cathedral's roof, and one of the volcanoes. Staff have always been very friendly and helpful.\",\n \"We had exactly the same experience that Lisette just described: No pool -it was been repaired- even though it was advertised, no sleeping not because of the construction but because of the pool´s motor when it was been filled and also due to the bar next door over the weekend... and bad service, specially at night.  We got no compensation even though we decided to stay in spite of the pool been repaired.  They did not seem to care, nor did they give much important to our words when we told them that we would give them a bad review due to all of the above and to the fact that they charged us 28% more than the initial amount advertised on booking.  We don't know if this was booking´s fault or their own, but we felt disappointed, neglected and uncomfortable.  With the great\",\n 'There are two Posada San Pedro accommodations in Antigua, Guatemala:  • Posada San Pedro I has 10 rooms and is located at 3ra Av. sur No. 15. • Posada San Pedro II has 8 rooms and is located at 7 avenida norte # 29.  On Tripadvisor.com, Posada San Pedro I is called “Hotel Posada San Pedro” & Posada San Pedro II is called “Hotel San Pedro”. The photos that accompany Hotel Posada San Pedro are a mixture of these two hotels. The pink walled rooms are from San Pedro I while the yellow walled rooms are from San Pedro II.  The hotel website provides information about both hotels.    We arranged airport pick up through San Pedro II and stayed there 3 nights in Dec. 2019. This is not a fancy hotel but a small, unique hotel with a special appeal; one that fits in well with the rest of',\n \"The hotel is quaint with clean rooms and a lovely rooftop patio. We have stayed there twice. The staff couldn't be more helpful. They go out of their way to assist.  It's a very comfortable and inviting place.  The only problem is email communication and confirmation of reservations. You are never sure if you have them or not.\",\n 'très agréable petite structure hôtelière, beau petit jardin et très beaux arrangements et végètaux. Au calme, à proximité du centre, terrasse bien agréable. Chambres propres, avec chacune un cachet différent. Bon rapport qualité prix.',\n 'We stayed two nights in an upstairs double room that was fine.  Rooms are situated around a lovely courtyard.  There is a rooftop patio with nice views of the surrounding volcanoes.  Good shower.  Did not include breakfast but there are good places to eat close by.  Can arrange shuttles to and from the airport. Wifi is spotty. They let you know in advance that they do not accept credit cards.  No problem with that.  However, when you pay in soles, they calculate the bill using 8 quetzales per dollar instead of the going rate of 7.5.  Not a big difference, but slightly irritating,',\n 'Excelente ubicación y muy bien antendida. Es una muy buena opción para alojar en Antigua, muy limpio, tranquilo, un buen desayuno a la hora que lo pidas y a un buen precio. Tiene buen internet y el ambiente es muy hogareño, te pasan una llave del hotel y puedes moverte en él como si estuvieras en tu casa.',\n 'The owner has collected various antiques, and other collectables for 21 years I think it is, and this guest house is filled with all sorts of items - very different and interesting. The service was excellent and location great. Our room was functional.',\n 'Great location, cute hotel with fun decor and every room a different shape and size. Large rooms, free wifi, really nice and helpful owner, and excellent location. My room was huge but the shower water came out as a small stream rather than shower. And because the location is good, there is a fair amount of street noise for some of the rooms.',\n 'You know you are in Guatemala!  Authentic, charming, and full of character.   Guatemalan antiques and artisan furniture fill the common areas (every inch) and the rooms.  Not a large courtyard to roam about like some of the Antigua hotels have .. small & charming.  We had room almost in the lobby ... ask for upstairs room.  Our room was perhaps configured as a second thought .. not real walls ... the wall that separated us from the lobby was made of window panels w/ curtains or shutters for privacy .. which then meant little light. It also was next to the kitchen so a bit noisy.   It was a beautiful room, though. The staff was super nice and helpful .. courteous.  You will love your stay here and feel as if you have escaped the hotelesque places.  Perfect location.',\n 'We stayed for four nights and enjoyed the perfectly appointed room. Breakfast next door at the Porta Hotel was included and was something we looked forward to after our morning walks. We also appreciated the use of the sauna since we arrived on a cold, rainy day! The staff at Encatada was gracious and helpful, serving coffee at any time of day. We stayed in the smallest room (#5) and think this rating might have been 5 stars with a different room assignment.',\n \"A beautiful hotel in many ways but the rooms are tiny. No place to put a chair.    Decor is fabulous but service is mediocre    My work  is paying but if I were footing  the  bill I would leave.  It's  cold too.  End of august  and chilly.\",\n 'Posada las rosas has an excelent ubication, almost next to the central park,  many restaurants, bars and atm. People here is very kind and is not an expensive place. They give you a key to get into The hotel couse they use to close The door At 6 pm but you can arrive at any time you want.',\n 'This is a beautiful hotel with a very peaceful atmosphere.  The rooms were a little dark but well furnished with an excellent powerful shower.  The beds were small, we had a triple room but there were two very small doubles.  The breakfast was really very good as was dinner although the bar was over priced with little atmosphere.   We found information a little scarce so did not know about the other part of the hotel.  The chocolate and candle factories were no more than a small shop and the museums were a bit lacking but overall it is a nice place just a little impersonal.  ',\n \"We spent New Years here and it was beautiful. My one complaint was at check out. They add 10% tip in your total room charge. That's $25 per day. I had been tipping the staff all along so when the bill came I had an issue with it. They eventually resolved it but suddenly the staff was not so nice. They need to be up front with this. Rooms are great and the breakfast was also good.\",\n 'Nice rooms with decent beds located 10 minutes from the main square in Antigua. We had a dorm room with 3 other roommates, the space is quite limited, as in most hostels, but the rooms are nice for the price paid. Breakfast is included as part of the rates and food is really good. Internet signal is only available in the main area/dining room but it\\'s quite fast. One shower for all the dorm rooms, but many restrooms available throughout the hostel. They also have a small \"bodega\"/luggage room if you need to leave your bags after you check out, and they can arrange trips around Antigua as well as shuttles out of town at the front desk and they have laundry services (around the same price as everywhere else in town).  The food stand/restaurant located at the lobby is quite good as',\n 'We just stayed a night there and had a very good time. The price-service compability is amazing and you get a very delicious breakfast in the morning. Within 5-10 minutes you are in town.perfect. Free Wifi and a quiet backyard makes it a good deal.',\n \"85Q per night. The internet rate is HIGHER than the in-person rate, so go there in person for a cheaper rate.  Place is simple. Minimal but adequate facilities, good shared shower facilities, pleasant breakfast, wonderful staff.  The place isn't fantastic, but it feels really homely. The rooms surround this nice little garden!  Location is in a quiet corner of Antigua - still in walking distance to most places though.\",\n 'I was there with a group of college students for the week.  Most of the college students were between the ages of 25-35 (graduate students).  We had fun, and nearly took over the hostel since there were so many of us.  The service was great and the staff very friendly.  It was clean and always neat.  I felt safe and secure there and there were no security problems.  But the walls are \"paper-thin\" and you could hear someone flushing the toilet or taking a shower even if your room was down the hall.  Additionally, the \"hot water\" was nearly non-existent  as the electric fixtures preparing hot water really did not work.  Don\\'t touch them, you will get a shock!  The food they prepared for us was basic and good.  The internet connect was slow, but it worked.  Overall it was a nice',\n 'Very nice hotel in the centre of Antiqua. You can easily walk anywhere within the city. The rooms are a bit old but that is in the style of the hotel. Bathrooms and the rooms were very clean.  My luggage did not arrive and the hotel called American Airlines a few times to help retrieve it. Very helpfull.  Breakfast is very tasty!',\n 'beautiful courtyard, decor, views from the roof.  calm and relaxing.   the rooms differ.   ours was very small, barely a place to put our suitcases ( i kept mine on the wide window sill) . while the place seems clean, i didnt like the darkness in the rooms, the shag carpets and it had a bit of a mouldy smell to it.  i think the price is a bit too high for what you are getting.   for this price you would have a flawless place in mexico.  nice touch:  coffee, tea and cake out in the courtyard for the evening.',\n 'Very nice hotel, its just like in the pictures!! very comfortable  and  great place  to stay  in Antigua.
