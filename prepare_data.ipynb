      "[\"Casa del Arco is a very conveniently located bed and breakfast place in Antigua Guatemala. It's just two minute walking distance from Parque Central and the Arch of Catalina. In fact given its central location, just about every attraction in the town is accessible by walk. The place is a cosy nook with few rooms. That said, you can almost have their little lounge to yourself when you want. The rooms are tastefully done with Guatemalan textile and clean. The bed was comfortable as well. The only issue I had was the lack of ventilation. The room window opened to the steps just besides the room that would compromise my privacy but as I had mentioned, there are few rooms and very less people in the property so it was fine. The highlight of the place is the breakfast cooked by the\", 'Good location on the NW of town, especially if youre going to Antiguena spanish school. 100q for good sized private twin room with shared bathroom - great price Nice ish garden with a swing and hamock Basic bathrooms - very tatty but has hot showers always (if you keep the water flow slow) Super basic, pretty dirty kitchenette Loads of cats and dogs  Its very cheap and basic. If thats what your after, its ok', 'My wife and I, along with 13 others in our group, stayed a total of three nights in Hotel Palacio Chico 1940--not to be confused with Hotel Palacio Chico 1850 which is a totally different hotel. Our group members were completely satisfied with their stay. The service was exceptionally accommodating. Since our three nights occurred over a period of 10 days while we volunteered and visited in other cities, they allowed us to store extra luggage between our stays. The rooms are a bit tight but the beds are comfortable. Some rooms have one bed, others have two, and some have a private bath and some shared. We preferred the two bed private bath option. It s a small hotel, with possibly ten to 15 rooms maximum. The included breakfast was satisfactory with fresh fruit and toast. Also', 'We went to the hotel directly to book a room. The receptionist at first gave us a really high price then lowered it. When we asked how much it costs in qetales she gave us an 8.2 comission rate to dollars and I knew she was randomly goving us a non existing rate so then she \"lowered\" it to the real rate. After we agreed that the price includes breakfast the following morning we get to breakfast and received two plain pieces of toast and fruit while theother tables received also eggs and plantines. So I asked if we also get eggs abd plantines and she replied \"no\". How come we didn\\'t get the same breakfast when we paid for it?? Not a good experience at all at the hotel. There are much better places in Antigua to stay.', \"I'm going to break this up with the good and bad.   Good: Location Free breakfast Hot shower Warm, helpful staff One hour massage for 150Q ($20)  Bad: Small rooms without great air circulation AWFUL quality beds Very noisy dogs next door  I'll let you decide which are more important to you. To me, an awful bed kills it for me. But the $20 massages made me feel better about my choice. Not sure if I'd come back because my back can't handle it.   By the way, the $50/night advertised on here is totally wrong. It ended up being $90/night for a triple room. Not really worth it to me since there are so many other choices.   \", \"I arrived late at night after a delayed bus journey and my original accommodation had been given away. This was the only place I could find which could accommodate me, so for that I was grateful. Priced at 100Q for a private room with wifi this seems decent value, however the rooms are incredibly basic, unclean with mosquitos everywhere and insects over the floor and in the bathroom. There was no key for the door apparently, however it did lock from the inside, although it did not feel a very secure place to stay other than having a night guard and big front door which is locked throughout the night.

It is located very conveniently close to the famous yellow Arch in Antigua and just down one block from the town square, shopping, banking and restaurants. You can't tell from the outside, but this small hotel has a beautiful courtyard with blooming plants, greenery and a pool. There is also a covered breakfast area that became our gathering place in the morning mostly because they had free coffee and cold water. Fortunately, our room was upstairs above the breakfast area. Even though there are stairs to haul your suitcases up and down, try to reserve room 10, 11 or 12. Those rooms have a balcony that you can watch Volcano Fuego erupt every night! There are several benches to sit on along the room\", 'Eight of us were staying in a home stay in Antigua, the last weekend we wanted four rooms in a nice hotel. Being we were already here we wanted to see the hotels and maybe even look at a room.  I was meeting my friend here to take a look. I arrived early. The front desk clerk was having a personal call and refused to acknowledge me or even look up at me.  I was ten minutes early so I took a look at the lobby and the pool. I used the men’s room.  The front desk went wild. She started screaming at me that men’s room was only for guests. She was screaming at me and it was embarrassing. She basically kicked me out!  Needless to say we did NOT book this hotel for our group! ', 'We booked this hotel because of its great location, pool and parking. It had good reviews in Lonely Planet.  I had requested an upstairs room, with a balcony, and that is what we got, with a view of the volcano. The room was very clean.  However, it is way overpriced for what you get- tiny, although quaint and rather charming rooms. The big drawback was the noise. It is next door to a venue with five bars in it, and very loud music reverberates through the walls from Thursday - Saturday night, until 1am. There was no way we were going to be able to sleep through that! To their credit, the management rang the bar and asked them to turn it down, which they did, but it was still terribly loud. The manager then came up and offered us a room at another hotel, which we were happy to', \"It's a very nice Resort with Great Food and Beautiful Scenery in the Mountains close to the City of Guatemala and not too far from the Many Volcano' there.

I was very disappointed and upset to be treated this way specially after I explained him that I already paid for two nights almost $300 and that I had a red eye fly and just wanted to rest. somehow we negotiated to $30 but still feels like a rip off.

I've been here with family, friends, and strangers about to become friends.  This is not a five-star property.  Its conversion from hacienda to hotel was slap-dash and haphazard. There can, at times, be too much street noise, and the wifi is wonky. ...but I'll be back, and I'll recommend it to friends as an oasis from their expectations.  The courtyards and walk ways will hang with dense flowering vines in the spring and summer, that when added to the flowering shrubs and trees perfumes this small world in a way Chanel aspires to.

Upon arrival I noticed the magnificent garden and all it’s beautiful flowers.  The staff was very welcoming.  They do a lot of business with my company often so they already knew to have certain accommodations in place. The location is perfect. Two blocks close to the Arch, a few blocks close to Central Park and best a bunch of restaurants. Breakfast was delicious. Overall, I had a good stay. One suggestion.... Leave a night light at the entrance. My flight was at 6am so I had to leave at 4am. I was in room #18. I had to use the flashlight on my phone to find my way to the front.', 'I recently stayed at the Villa Colonial Hotel during a work conference. This colonial style hotel is very well taken care of. The rooms are nice and clean, the bathrooms are comfortable and the ambiance overall is great. The food is good although the restaurant could benefit from offering more choices. My stay overall was very enjoyable.', \"The hotel is medium size and they made a big effort to give you the feel of a Colonial town, it just doesn't feel very authentic. It's at a walkable distance from the central park (about 9 blocks). Food is good, coffee is great, most of the staff is friendly, however the front desk people were a bit cold and will not make eye contact. The bathroom design is not very smart, there is a step after you open the door and the light switch is beyond the step, so you can easily trip on it in the dark. The shower has a partial wall and that's it, so water gets all over the floor making it very slippery. The pool is pretty and a good size, with warmish water. The little Plaza area is gorgeous and the garden is very well taken care of.\", \"What a nice place for a stay!  Great restaurant, good food.  Beautiful views of a volcano from a very comfortable balcony off the restaurant.  Wonderful service and really good staff herding a bunch of people around. The gardens are beautiful and extensive.  Lots of seating areas in with the flowers.  The colors are so bright through out you almost need sunglasses.  If I have one complaint it's the same complaint I have when I travel and use hotels.

Pool is verry small', 'Lovely quaint \"hotel\", more like a glorified bed and breakfast. It is a very large \"old\" house transformed into a \"hotel\".  It is probably a 3 to 3.5 star small \"hotel\", rustic, with a great location in the middle of town, close to all must see sites. Breakfast was very limited (scrambled egss, beans and one type of white cheese). But good value ', 'Great hotel with a beautiful flowered courtyard for breakfast or relaxing.  A short walk from the Central Plaza and most attractions. The neighborhood was quiet. Extremely helpful staff.  While most of the staff spoke little English the manager who was present each day was fluent.  The manager gave us information on tours and shops.  Breakfast was relatively simple but good.  Our room was not very large but was well outfitted and the bed was comfortable.  We had no issues with hot water (there was plenty).Ask for a second floor room, they have  view of Fuego ( an active volcano).   There were no negatives during our 4 night stay.  The hotel is a bargain.  We would stay there again. Stop for diner and music at the Santa Clara Cafe only a block away.', 'We were very happy with the Casa Noble. In fact we booked it for our return to Antigua. The staff were excellent, the breakfasts were very good as well as the location. The hotel is maybe 6 blocks from the Central Park. The room was very large, clean and had a good bathroom with lots of hot water. The hotel is in a old colonial building with a very nice garden. The rooms and lounge are decorated with antique style furniture. ', \"The good things: the hotel is stunning. There is a gorgeous courtyard with a manicured lawn overhung with trees and flowers. It's perfect for breakfast. My room was also gorgeous- every detail was beautiful. Even the doors were carved with a floral design. The staff is very helpful.  The less good things: I got about 90 seconds of hot water for 2 out of 3 showers. There was neither a/c nor a fan.  Merely irritating things: the front door is locked, so every time you come back to the hotel, you have to knock and hope someone heard you. Also, it's a little ways from the central part of town, but it's a small town, so that's only about 10-15 minutes of walking.\", 'We were in the room in front of the entrance, which has a very squeaky gate (a drop of oil would sort the problem in two seconds) so we could hear everyone who came in or went out; also people tended to stop in front of the room to talk and they could look inside through the windows. If you closed the shutters however, the room was very dark. Maybe the rooms upstairs are better. The bed sheets were old and looked worn and they did not fit the double mattresses. Also the pillows were pretty horrendous. The towels were a bit threadbare. On the plus side, the shower was good with very hot water and the room was clean.  It could be a decent place but it needs looking after. It is certainly overpriced.', \"This place is a dump.  there is no hot water here during the day.  In the evenings yes, but not during the day.  the shower was disgusting.  don't waste your money here.  For less money you can stay at a hotstel and have hot water.\", \"This hotel was terrible in every measureable way. Throughout our entire stay we were the only people in this hotel.

For some reason prices were extremely high at other places because of the weekend.. We were welcomed by a friendly young woman who showed us the room. Had a private room with a nice bed on the first floor at the front of the building. The shower was actually one of the best we have had, good amount of water and warm (hot!).

Overall a decent place if you’re not too picky. ', \"As a former resident of Antigua there are lots of hotels like this one.  Like others have said in the reviews, the rooms are super clean, the bathrooms are nice, they have flat screen tv's in every room and it truly is a cute little hotel.  What is exceptional is how nice, kind, and super friendly the owner and his son are.  Thats what makes this review a little difficult for me.  I so want to love this hotel and support this hotel and the owners but there are 2 things that you will likely struggle with if you stay here.  1. Its kinda noisey.  Yes, they have parking inside....literally inside.  We were in bed and asleep at 10:00 pm and awaken to the sound of a car backing into the downstairs court yard and they noise was loud enough to sound like we were sleeping in the garage. \", 'very nice stay, nice corner garden room, with confortable beds. bathroom a little small but confortable, need more space in the bassin may be  Delicious breakfast at the hotel as well as the bar ,i had some sándwiches to remember... very nice attention, i would really recommend your stay in Porta Antigua', \"Great setting, very relaxing and good location about 5-10 min walk from the main square. Lots of really positive stuff about the resort - gym is good, pool area is great for kids as is the playground. Deluxe garden room was recently renovated and very smart. Dinner at the restaurant was very good. Most of the staff were also lovely and very friendly and helpful. Relaxed vibe.  The negative stuff - mainly hinged around our reception experiences to be honest. We arrived at 830pm, one guy on reception and a large wedding party taking place so probably a bit stressed. However, he wasn't very welcoming, was quite dismissive and just wanted to get me to sign various paperwork, give us the key and send us on our way.

I would 100% recommend this place.', 'The staff at Hotel Posada Santa Teresita is  friendly and helpful. The owner is lovable. The room was simple but nice. Location very good, but a bit away from Plaza Mayor. Good value for money. Generally, I  recommend this place.', 'The hotel is very clean, seems new, and is in good working order. The customer service is impecable and breakfast was very good.  As far as the negatives, parking was a nightmare, since they do not have own parking and we were sent to a sketchy place. The parking attendant seemed confused as to which hotel we were coming from, and he did not tell us that other cars would be blocking our exit. It ended up working out well. Also, bathrooms are very small, as there is no place to put down your toiletries bag. Finally, the street the hotel is on does have heavy traffic at times (I was there on a weekend).', \"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Hotel is lovely, rooms are comfortable with modern bathrooms. It's slightly further away from the centre of town, so while this is ok during the day, it may make some people feel slightly unsafe walking there late at night, as the streets are not well lit. We had no problems though. Breakfast here was fantastic - freshly made to order and huge servings. The only thing we would say is that the service isn't fantastic. Since it is a small hotel, quite a lot of the time there is only one staff member available, and sometimes this person did not speak English. We had a few times where we had some questions and couldn't really get assistance from the hotel. But we still enjoyed our stay here, as this didn't bother us too much.\", \"The room has a view on the main street of Antigua. The location is very central and there is a very small balcony that allowed us to see the busy street from the second floor. The rooms have Wi-fi, TV and a safe.

The breakfast is served every morning on a roof terrasse that is beautifully decorated and where you can also hang out throughout the day to read or browse internet. The woman serving breakfast is super nice and the breakfast are delicious: there is a choice of main meal and there is a food display of: coffee or tea, fresh water, bread, cereals, fresh fruits and cheese. Fresh orange juice was also part of the breakfast.  Only negatives: I think you pay more just because the location is on the main street. Also there is\", 'Nice hotel in central location.

The location is excellent, two blocks away from the Central Park and the rooftop view is beautiful. Breakfast was provided each morning which was good. Being from Canada, it was a little bit pricey because of the exchange but they have no control over that. Don’t forget to include the 22% tax on the posted rate which we forgot about. However, our room had no curtain in the bathroom so we were unable to leave the window open while we were showering which resulted in the room being very humid and steamy. Additionally the roll up blind in the bedroom was broken which reduced the amount of fresh air coming into the room.

Breakfast was ok, and parking is not on site but 2.5 blocks away wasn't so inconvenient. You can walk to the central square in 10-15 min.

I arrived close to 2am (around 3 hours late) due to my flight being delayed but the friendly, smiling owner/manager was there to greet me and show me to my room. There is also a nice cafe on site. I would recommend this guesthouse. ', 'I love staying at Hotel Casa del Parque, the rooms are beautiful, the staff is lovely, great location and the pool and sauna are fab!!   Points to note, if you are a light sleeper, make sure you ask to not have the room that is by the street, as it is in a central location there is a lot of foot traffic and although Antigua mostly winds down around 10pm on the weekend it can get loud!', \"This was our first visit to Guatemala and we were very pleased with our experience at Casa del Parque.  The architecture and decor were beautiful, as was the flower and greenery- filled courtyard and pool area.  Our room was clean, nicely decorated, and very comfortable.  We were travelling without children so didn't mind the proximity of our room to a nearby very busy nightclub; I would suggest contacting the hotel prior to making a reservation to assure that if you seek quiet on the weekends that you are in a different area of the hotel.  On the flip side, we appreciated the proximity of this hotel to the vast offerings of restaurants, clubs and pubs.  And it is only a few doors down from the beautiful central Park.  Felt safe walking throughout the city and enjoyed the\", 'Having stayed in Antigua previously, we then decided to book an ‘upmarket’ hotel for our final night pre-flight. This hotel was in a decent location, but it was dirty and not comfortable compared to the cheaper hotel we had previously stayed in. When we arrived we had to ask to have the sheets changed due to being dirty, and throughout our stay we also noticed that the mugs had old lipstick on, and towels were dirty, and so were the pillowcases. It was the first time I considered using my sleeping bag inner to sleep in the bed during my entire stay in Guatemala. The staff offered no solution to the problems. Antigua is walkable where you stay, so the location is not at all relevant. Definitely stay elsewhere to get much better value for money and stay clean', \"I was GRANDPAcking in Antigua for 3 nights. On my previous visit I stayed in 2 other hotels. This time, I tried the Santa Teresita. I pre-booked a Single Room online at a 68% discount. This brought the price down from US$33 / night to US$10.50 (or GTQ121 including the additional 22% taxes). This came with a free breakfast. The room was small but came with an ensuite with daily housekeeping, a hot shower and cable TV. A Breakfast is worth about GTQ25 ... so the room was excellent value at GTQ121 but IT IS NOT worth the Rack Rate of GTQ380 / night that it is listed for. It is worth about GTQ175 / night including Breakfast. The hosts were nice people and it had a comfy common area. It is, probably, a little too much 'on the edge of town centre' for some people ... it was a decent\", \"My booking included breakfast but one of the young male staff member attempted to charge me.  He told me only two breakfasts were included and the others with eggs were not included.  I agreed to pay for the non included breakfast because I wanted the eggs.  When we were checking out, I told the woman I need to pay for breakfast and she corrected me saying the breakfast for me was included.  This is how I caught the previous man in a lie.  Otherwise I liked the hotel.  I paid top dollar since it was peak time.  They do not accept visa, only cash.  Well I'm not sure I believe that now since that man lied about the breakfast.\", \"It's a basic hotel, the staff were nice and friendly. The location is ok, slightly on the fringe of the centre and at night, the street lights are not so bright in the area. If you happen to get the bedroom at the back of the hotel, there is an open-air market that starts really early and can be noisy for those light sleepers. Otherwise, it's ok if you're looking for a cheap and clean place to stay in Antigua.\", \"I stayed here for two nights and thought it was a good budget hotel.  There is a kitchen you can use and the rooms are very clean.  The owners and staff were always available and very helpful.  It's on a busy road, but the rooms are tucked away in back so noise was not a problem.  It is not fancy, but I think it's perfect for the budget traveler:  quiet, clean, decent location at a great price with friendly owners.\", 'We booked one night in Antigua so wanted it to be special. Visiting during Holy Week we wanted to be sure to see the procession over the flower petal murals. Casa Buena Vista was perfect as the procession went right past the front of the hotel!  The location is perfect for exploring the city as well. It’s a great place from which to launch a walking circuit of all the sites in the city and is very close to a square where a (cooked) food market bustles at night. Plenty of tiendas for essentials like wine and snacks too.   As for the property, it is just lovely. Pass through a locked gate to a gorgeous small colonial courtyard with a small fountain. There is also a rooftop where we sipped wine before dinner.   We were in room 3 and my suggestion would be to avoid rooms 1 thru 3.', 'I made a Booking.com reservation. And they ask to paid in the hotel the night. Then they charge me the night in my credit card. weeks and weeks asking the refund, and only a waste of time. Very polite in the whatsapp, but at the end they took my money twice, never got the refund. Just thieves. AVOID AT ALL COST, WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.', 'The Hotel is well located. Rooms are very nice, clean and the bed was really comfy. Rooms had Cable and Fans. The bathroom was pretty cool, tiles are like rocks, feels your are in a waterfall, although is missing a bit of an air outlet.  It has a parking lot just behind it (with a private entrance to the hotel), for 50Q will keep your car the whole day.- Remember to book your space in advance.  It has a nice location (not to near to the Santa Catalina Gate but perfect to walk). Staff was extra friendly and ready to help.   It has a nice patio that was lit up at night. Very dreamy.   I would stay here again.', \"We stayed here for five nights whilst we were in Guatemala.  It seems that many stay in the South West of Antigua where McDonald's and Subway were located, but I am glad that we stayed in the opposite side of the city, where it was quiet. We walked all over the town - even the main market was about 15 - 17 minutes on foot.  We had to go to the bank in the Central Park a couple of times, but it was within ten minutes.  Breakfast (included) consists of 2 eggs, black beans, fried plantains, and 2 roles (and coffee or juice).  We had to leave early twice, so we had breakfast 3 times at its lovely dining area.  Very satisfying.  When people have dinner in the courtyard, the noise comes right into your room, but normally they leave by 9 PM.  2 bottles of water replenished daily. \", 'We had no idea when walking through the thick wooden doors off the cobbled street that we would be entering a beautiful courtyard, a lovely garden in the middle with small table and chairs around the outside. Our room was overlooking the courtyard and was a very large comfortable room, very unusual. There is no bar or restaurant but they serve a lovely breakfast. It is in the heart of Antigua and so very easy to walk around', 'The rooms are OK but the majority has a shared bathroom which is shared with many and super small with the toilet in there too. Be careful with the prices they quote online as they will add 22% tourist tax!! It does represent itself as a budget hotel but in my experience the quality is definitely not higher than a hostel.', 'My wife and I spent 3 weeks at this apartment hotel and were totally satisfied with our accommodation..  It was very clean and bright and one of the best equipped places we have ever stayed at.  This was a very important feature for us because my wife likes to cook a lot when we are away and normally the lack of good kitchen utensils limits what she can do but this was not the case here.  The location is great being within easy walking distance of the Parque Cenral and the great restaurants in the centre of Antigua.  Lesley and her staff were superb and responded very graciously to every request we made.  We will certainly stay here again on our next trip to beautiful Antigua', 'Once we arrived we were greeted at the closed gate by the 24 hour security guard. We were pleasingly surprised when we walked into the condo. We had a small living room, dining room, full kitchen with cooking utensils, washer & dryer and private open air outside sitting area downstairs. Upstairs was the bathroom and bedroom with ample room. Our walk into town discovered a very small grocery store 1 block away for basic needs but a larger grocery store on the other side of the main town courtyard about 6 blocks away. Everything you need to do such as shopping and restaurants is within walking distance and a car is not needed while at this location.  We did use the car to go sight seeing, off the complex, to the Filadelfia Coffee Plantation.   The only negative feature was the', \"The Hotel itself wasn't too bad. It was a cute style with rooms that were decent and clean linen and towels. There was Wifi. The water was lukewarm. The view from the terrace was gorgeous. The location was pretty good but it is more of a quiet place to stay. The biggest issue we had was that they put us in one room for a night because other room were occupied but then they needed to move us the next night because the room we were in was the only one able to fit more beds for a larger group. This was a huge inconvenience and had they planned better it could have been avoided... otherwise pretty cute place!\", \"Situated a 10 min walk from the main square.  In a quiet street but with shops and bars not far away (and an amazing bakery). Our room was in a row just after reception, and had a comfortable bed with clean linens. Clean towels and toiletries provided. Shower was powerful but at best only warm. Free drinking water provided. The roof terrace view was amazing, overlooking the town and volcanoes. The owner and his family were very nice, and also helpful with information. It's a bit annoying that you aren't supplied with a front door key. Overall very good value. \", 'Cosy little place down on 2da avenida sur. The staff were so nice and friendly and always offering us tea and coffee! The Wi-Fi was good and it was very safe. You had to be let in by the night guard each night. Good value for money in Antigua. Not a place to stay if looking to meet others, more a quiet place to rest the head.', 'This small hotel is well executed, the staff is super helpful and the breakfast on the roof terrace was pleasant. That said, like many hotels in Antigua, you don’t want to open your window to the street (most rooms) as the noise continues well into the night.  Antigua has become one big hotel; I doubt that anyone actually lives there anymore. There are a few hotels on the periphery that have the space to block out the street noise, but unfortunately, this isn;t one of them. Maybe it’s all those old school buses we send down to Guatemala…', 'Comfortable stay at Posada Don Valentino.  Our second stay at this hotel, and we will continue to return.  The rooms are a good size, beds are comfy, and the rooms and bathrooms are always clean.  Great location in Antigua, easy to get to any part of the city.', 'First the good, common space nice enough. Staff friendly. Beds just ok.   Not great, noise, shower, cleanliness. They could spend very little and add fresh paint , bed sheets, curtains.., they need to clean up the place. Old run down. ', 'The room was nothing special and not inviting for relaxing. If you want a room to sleep and nothing more, it’s fine. The shared spaces were very nice, with a roof top balcony where we watched the fireworks at New Year which was amazing. The staff were very helpful and kind, although there was a mix up with our online payment that resulted in us taking out quetzales that we later didn’t need. We had a room with a double bed that was pushed against two walls and so was quite cramped, even for a couple. Our window was out onto what appeared to be a storage area for cleaning supplies, which meant we got to hear a lot of morning conversations from the housekeeping staff.  The hallways were pretty loud too. It seemed most rooms had no exterior windows at all so I’m glad we had our one', 'This hotel is operated by a group of women very close to the central plaza in Antigua. It is very clean and well staffed. The staff will make transportation shuttle arrangements to other parts of Guatemala. They were able to assist us with everything.', 'El hotel is advertised as HOTEL EURO MAYA SUITES, but the real name is HOTEL EURO MAYA. I select this hotel due to the nice reviews I was reading on TripAdvisor, my question is those reviews are real? Or people’s opinion on service are kind of crazy lol. Or my standards are too high. The hotel website and pictures are well done Photoshop because the REAL hotel are totally different form reality. I paid ($131.85 US Dollars for 2 night like $922.95 Quetzals) with breakfast included. Room are terrible poor clean and nasty towels really old and almost useless.  The location is far from the central square, so not convenience location as the reviews said. Love Antigua Guatemala, great UNESCO cultural site and many things to learn from the Colonial time in Central America.', 'With the price of Hotel Euro Maya being exceedingly inexpensive, one shouldn’t expect a 5-star hotel.  The hotel had good and bad points.  * Location: The hotel’s location is ideal--less than one block from Central Park, which the whole town revolves around.   * Staff: Extremely polite, helpful, accommodating, and friendly.  * Architecture: The hotel’s interior space is gorgeous, with a Spanish Colonial style, open-air courtyard and hallways.   * Rooms: The rooms are a little dreary; definitely less spectacular than the public areas.  They could use some fresh paint and less shabby furnishings.  The worst thing about the rooms are the truly awful travel posters dotting the walls.  The posters are cheap and in shoddy frames.  The place would instantly look so much better without', 'Euro Maya is a nice, small hotel, with a great location! The staff are friendly and helpful. The room was clean, and the breakfast was fine. Euro Maya has two things going for it: 1. The roof-top terrace. A great spot for breakfast and enjoying the volcano views! 2. It is 3/4 a block from the Central Park. If you are looking for a posh place that has top-of-the line sheets, towels and other services, this is not it. If you are looking for a clean, friendly, affordable place to lay your head, Euro Maya fits the bill! ', 'We booked with this hotel when we returned to Antigua mainly because it is mistakenly listed in Booking as a 4* hotel. Well here are some facts. THIS IS NOT A 4* HOTEL, its a travel agency that happens to rent some rooms. You could tell from property sign too. The location is superb but that\\'s all. The problem with the disgraceful service began before we even step our foot it the \"hotel\", as they charged my credit card (issued by european bank = got lousy exchange rate) without asking me while I wasnt there !!!!! We arrived before the supposed check in time and when I complained, they talked about some non-existent policy for which Booking.com was mentioning nothing.   The Front Desk employees (or whatever this supposed to be, probably the travel agency) could hardly speak', 'We enjoyed our stay at El Hotel Meson de Maria.   Everyone was incredibly professional and courteous,   Breakfast was delicious and a perfect way to start your day  The location was incredible, we walked everywhere.  El Meson de Maria is  at the center of everything!.    This hotel is very clean and  incredibly charming, and decorated just right for Antigua!   The only thing we would of liked was for our room to be a bit bigger, and the bathroom updated.      Having said that, we highly recommend for anyone to stay at this hotel.', \"We were in Antigua for a birthday celebration, we booked this hotel because we thought it was centrally located and the price was ok. The hotel is located in town not very central but accessible. They offer parking but it's 4 blocks away. The bad thing about this hotel is that it's located next to the Alliance française, the weekend that we stayed there they had a concert. We were ok until the bad concert lasted until 1 am. At 1 am I had to ask the watchman to call the police, be aware that at 6:00 pm the manager leaves, they close the door and there is nobody to assist you. Also across the street there is an establishment that I am not sure if it is a bar, restaurant or hotel. They had groups of noisy people coming and going all night long. We didn't sleep, it was horrible.\", 'We had casa noble booked as a second option as we needed to extend our stay by one night and our accommodation told us they were full. We saw the reviews on here so went to check the place out. We were pleasantly surprised to see a very pretty hotel set around a lovely garden. We had a look at a couple of rooms and they looked clean and comfortable. The owner was also very friendly and helpful. In the end our hotel had availability and pure lazyness stopped us from moving hotels for one night. I would, however without hesitation stay at this hotel if we were to come back to antigua.', 'Stayed one night as our first hotel was full on the last night of the stay. Place is in a sorry state of disrepair and looked very unloved. Rooms and general appearance are a bit shabby and we were the only ones in the hotel despite the entire town being full for a big event. Service was not obvious and the place seemed spooky, Luckily just for one night but in good conscience cannot recommend.', 'We stumbled onto Hotel Casa Antigua at the last minute, as we were changing our travel plans. It is made from two adjoining, renovated colonial houses with high ceilings, antique touches (including a pulley to open/shut a skylight in room #5), and beautiful gardens/courtyards. The beds were comfortable, and--importantly for our family--there were multiple rooms with options for 3-4 beds. It is two blocks away from the central square and minutes from many great shops and restaurants. Although in general the hotel feels quite secluded from city noise, there were some modest issues due to the configuration of rooms opening to the courtyard. At late afternoon (and briefly in the AM), there is a huge flock of birds roosting and causing a ruckus in some of the trees in the courtyard.', \"This is a centrally located hotel for people wanting a decent place to stay at a fair price in Antigua. We had two rooms and they were very different in size so worth asking for a spacious room when booking. The smaller room also smelt  very strongly of cleaning fluid but it did have a window and fan. The staff were warm and friendly. There was free water and tea/coffee on tap which we hadn't found in the more expensive hotels. My private bugbear is hotels charging you for bottled drinking water in small bottles so fair play to Casa Antigua which does not do this. There are lovely places to sit quietly and a shop selling local goods.\", 'I would concur with all the positives about this hotel, i.e., cleanliness, convenience of location, breakfast, etc. We did not meet the owner, but rather dealt with a young lady who was new to the area, so the fact that she spoke English, did not help us much in answering local questions. The other receptionist did not speak English. She was on duty when we checked out so I was unable to resolve the $100 overcharge on our bill until I returned home. It was eventually resolved with a series of emails. If it weren’t for this uniquely negative experience, I would return to this hotel and recommend it to others. However, with so many hotels, we decided to choose another when we returned at the end of our vacation. It was not nearly as nice and more expensive.', 'I stayed 4 nights at this cute little hotel. It’s located at an amazing spot in the very centre, a minute walk from the park. I stayed in room 15 which has a king size bed and a private balcony with a view on the street and a volcano. The property is well maintained, has a nice pool and inner garden. Good value for money! Next door is El Barrio a traditional complex with 5 different bars. Mind that if you stay in room 15 that you will hear some faint music till around midnight. After that it’s quiet. In the other rooms I guess you are fine. We didn’t mind it, at all, it even gave some charm, guess we are city people :)', 'The hotel and the rooms are nice. My wife and I got the Mountain View room and the only thing we didn’t like was the bathroom. It was really small and when flushing toilet the water pressure was super super slow.  Bathroom where toilet is was really small. Need to leave door open while using it.   Really important: if you like to party. There is a super cool bar next door that lots of people visit and socialize.  If you like to sleep early to get energize for your tours, this is not the best place to stay.   Noise ends up around 1:00am   Costumer service was really amazing.  We really enjoy their service from everyone.  ', 'This is a lovely hotel right off the main square. Has a pool, which is great. Right next door to a few bars so its nice to have that near if that interests you, but if you have issues with noise, request an interior room. Very nice staff.', 'Antigua already has a lot of personality, and this hotel continues that. Helpful staff, rooms with character, great views including volcanos, They were very helpful when my initial room was a challenge as I have a light disability. It was exchanged without fuss. The food was excellent including provision for allergies.', 'This hotel has great service, beautiful grounds, clean rooms and comfy beds. Loved the amenities and the location. I loved having filtered water in the room.   The hotel restaurant is lacking in vegetarian options on their menu... surprising given the focus on sustainability. One night I had an asian dish for dinner.', 'I stayed with my wife for two nights and it was very quite and comfortable. The price is good and cheap. The owner are very nice and welcoming. The place is clean and they have also a good kitchen. Free wi fi  The bilding is a bit old and not all the rooms are the same but ours was very nice', 'We stayed 3 nights. We appreciated the warm welcome of the staff and room was clean and perfectly matching with the description of the website.  Many advantages with this hotel: located in the city center (everything on walk can be done), agencies very closed, quiet, ect....

The only inconvenient was that other customer were a little bit behaving loudly during night...

The staff is friendly but unfortunately they don't do anything if you complain about the noise at 11 or 12 o'clock in the evening ... you can hear every noise and movement in the other rooms and outside, we were also unlucky to have clients in the hotel that did not care about other clients that want to sleep. Do not recommend this hotel if you want some peace and quiet.\", 'Although out of the central district of town, the property is lovely with a large garden.  Apparently we were lucky to get an interior room opening to the garden as we overheard from others that exterior room fronting the street was noisy. Room was quite large with a cool dome.  No heat or AC: presumably temp is usually moderate (although reading another review, seems they were too hot.  Going in Dec, the weather was chilly and we were on the cold side). Main drawback is the included breakfast is mediocre at best. Otherwise, staff friendly and helpful.  It is a bit of a hike over uneven cobbled road into town but easy to get taxi or tuk-tuk service at reasonable cost.', 'First the positives. The hotel looks great and the grounds are a credit to the team responsible. The location with the restaurant overlooking an active volcano was spectacular, imagine dinner with a backdrop of lava spouting from a volcano. Probably not a daily event, but we were lucky. The hotel should however be better, and lets itself down. The rooms are clean, of a good size but lack air con. You would therefore expect to be able to ventilate by opening the windows, but with no insect screens, this is just not sensible, resulting in a stuffy room. The rooms also have no room safes. Guests can place valuables in security boxes at reception, but with travellers carrying tablets, laptops, cameras, phones etc this is not suitable or practical. It is really not good enough not to', \"A very pleasant hotel on the outskirts of the colonial city of Antigua. Lovely gardens, friendly staff and a good restaurant.  Our room was clean and a good size. My only complaint would be that the room was very dark even with the lights on. We walked into the main part of town every day but stayed at the hotel at night to eat after our tour finished, mainly because it the streets weren't well lit and the cobbled roads and sidewalk was very uneven with lots of holes.\", 'A very pleasant and nice hotel with relatively large rooms, good food, and a very helpful service.

Four blocks from the park and/or La Iglesia de San Francisco.  We stayed in the big suite w two beds.  We were thrilled to have a modest kitchen and hot water.  Okay, it  wasn't 400-year old adobe, but who cares when you have your own washer/dryer and stove?    Someone pointed out earlier that their slusing door wouldn't lock.  We found this to be true in our unit as well.  I ended up using the dustpan handle as a door lock, which worked alright.  I can understand her concern, as the unlocked door expised to the outside was unsettling.  Would we stay again?  Certainly.  Especially for an extended stay.\", 'I recently stayed in this hotel in Antigua, about 7 blocks from Central Park, beautiful, cozy two- story villas with washer, dryer, full kitchen, two beds + comfortable sofa bed.  Parking included right in front of the rooms. Would definitely recommend.', 'Lovely position and we had a nice room. Glad I was not on the courtyard though with people having breakfast right outside my bedroom window. What was so sad was the poor attitude of the front desk staff. Water was rationed with no attempt to offer filtered water. There was no tea service in the room. Morning tea was fine but any other was undrinkable as the manager either couldn’t or wouldn’t provide hot water. Maybe it was a lack of English but that is also not good enough for the front desk. By the way they charged for it! No effort made to resolve the problem. Plastic flower petals on towels ! Really! Don’t bother ! No turn down service so dirty towels and cups left all night. Not what I would call a “boutique” hotel. More a very average hotel with a label.', 'Do not stay here! We booked through booking.com and paid in cash when we checked out.

STEER CLEAR!! ', 'This hostel provides a bed, at an average price.The location is rather decent; it is where you want to be in Antigua. There was rather a problem with the cold at night and quite a strong smell of disinfectant at times, which at least tells me that some cleaning occurs there. It has little in the way of a social atmosphere and certainly lacks any of kind of usefulness or warmth from the staff. They are neither friendly, nor knowledgeable about the town or transport there. More importantly, during my stay, I began to suffer from the Zika Virus. While the hostel was of no fault there, what was concerning to me was that I was in bed for several days, moaning and looking dreadful, while the staff walked past, unconcerned. I would value some social responsibility.', \"We have just arrived here after reserving in advance. The rooms are not as shown in pictures. There is no natural light, some don't even have windows.

Place clean enough, decent location, decent shower. Pretty nice upstairs outside courtyard. There are places which offer better value for money elsewhere.', 'The receptionist provided us with little to no information as to the details of the hotel. We had to prompt every time. The room was clean but the walls are so thin that you can hear anyone who may be making some noise.  There is no air con or fan so when it is hot, it is very hot!  Breakfast was not included in our rate despite it saying it on our hotel room door and on our confirmation. When asking the staff about it, it wasnt really her problem so meh!  I would probably pay extra and stay elsewhere next time as Antigua is beautiful and deserves a better experience.', 'The rooms are a small box with no ventilation, no air circulation and not even a fan.  You get one tiny window with a \"courtyard\" view.  The shower only got to luke-warm, and they turn the water off periodically at night.   I will say that the staff was generally nice and they did their best to make our stay pleasant.  We had an evening flight, and the staff did let us keep our bags at the hotel after checkout.   This is NOT a luxury place.  It is in a decent location so if you just need a place to crash it might be ok for you.  We visited in December, so thankfully it was cold at night, I imagine it would be impossible to sleep if the temperature was hotter.', \"We booked at Monasterio because we got a very good deal through Expedia.

The hotel is a few blocks from the central park however, on the same street as the Santa Clara ruins, close to Hermano Pedro Church and many amenities.  The walk to central park is only 10 minutes maximum.  Which by the size of Antigua is very reasonable.  Many times we have walked around Antigua after dark.  It is a very safe place and there are a lot of police, tourist security and PMT (traffic police)', 'The room is very small, not very clean (dusty). The bed was very uncomfortable and there was hardly any hot water in the shower.', \"Casa Noble is very pretty and has really cute and spacious rooms. The staff is nice and the hotel is safe and quiet. The downside is that it's about a 10-15 minute walk from the central area...not a big deal during the day, but it's not recommended to do that walk at night. If you plan to have late evenings (after 10), I'd recommend staying a little closer to the central area (but not too close as it can be really loud, even late at night).\", 'We   booked    the    hotel   online   with  Expedia.   Afterwards,   we   found   the    same    hotel  at   much   lower  rates,  but   Expedia   would    not   let  us  cancel.       The   first    hotel   room   that  we   were  shown   was    nothing   extraordinary  for $100   usd   per   day,   It    had  a  dark,  dingy   bath   and    no  view.   After   expressing   dismay  with  the   price,  we  were   offered  to       move   upstairs   to  a   nicer    room.

I called Casa Noble directly, and Susana (owner/property mgr?) was very helpful over the phone.  I booked two rooms.  I did ultimately see this hotel listed in Lonely Planet with favorable comments.  Upon entering the hotel, there is a beautiful courtyard, and the property looks rather exquiste.  There are also beautiful views of the area volcanoes.  Both of our rooms were on the second floor, and were large.  The room I was staying in did lack some privacy because you had to keep the windows open (few places with AC in highlands), and people walking up the stairs could see into our room, but not the other ones.  I have to agree with the earlier comment about cleanliness--it could have', 'On the positive notes, the staff is amazing and goes above and beyond to please and help. The location is safe and convenient, and the breakfast is delicious, it includes the usual black beans, tomato sauce, omelette, pancakes, bread and toasts and a wide variety of extremely fresh fruits. But #1, if your room is on the ground floor, around the courtyard, the noise of the wheels of the luggage on the rocks and the conversations of people unaware of the proximity are not conducive to resting, especially that people gather at 7 right there for breakfast! But #1, there is a problem with the hot water, and there was several cold water showers.', 'One of the best hotels I stayed at. Nice staff, good breakfast and they have good coffee and cake in the evenings. Very nice decor.  Location is nice. The view from the rooftop is nice as well. Would definitely stay again!', 'Let me start by saying that this hotel has it all: great location, nice breakfast, splendid views from the terrace,... Unfortunately our rooms were not the ones we were waiting for: - The \"standard rooms\" we booked were a tiny 15sqm, not the advertised 20sqm. - The \"suite\" we booked (at double the price of a normal room just to be sure to have 2 separate beds, as advertised on the booking site) did not have 2 separate beds and was not a suite at all (unless you consider a public seating place a part of the room). We were indeed arriving late at the hotel, but that is no reason to give us the \"leftovers\" (we booked months in advance).', \"We spent three nights in Room 4 and one night in Room 6 during our stay. The hotel is located right on a busy corner across from a park and a church, but the interior rooms are super quiet. The courtyard is so beautiful, filled with flowering plants, trees, vines, a fountain, and lots of comfortable seating. Birds, including mourning doves, sparrows, and orioles call this place home. We spent many hours chilling there. Breakfast was delicious. Three mornings we had eggs, black beans, salsa, and fried plantains accompanied by bread and coffee/tea and one morning pancakes, fruit spread, and fresh fruit. Service was exceptionally friendly and accommodating. It was quiet during our stay, with only one or two other rooms occupied, so I can't attest to the sound during busy times.\", 'Pros:  Good location, friendly staff, good price Cons:  Rooms on the street are very noisy, so you should bring ear plugs or sleep medications.   Noise continues until 12:00 midnight and starts at 4:30 am.   Was also able to hear people in rooms next door.    Breakfast one morning was just toast, jam and fruit.   The next morning eggs and fruit.  The third morning we decided to go to a restaurant and get a more substantial breakfast.    Given that we were in a coffee producing country, i expected good coffee in the mornings.  But this was the worst coffee I’ve ever had.   Very watery and weak.

The room is very spacious    Dislikes:  SUPER THIN WALLS, I heard everything going on late night including extracurricular activities, including the music.

The rooms facing the street are very nice and if you're a people watcher and have a great view of the street below.  It's located  just before the famous arc (so it's almost always busy).  Despite the people, we didn't find it too noisy for a good nights rest (just be sure to close the balcony door)!  What really made this experience great for us was the service.  Breakfast is included in the stay, which is always a key selling point for me.  But beyond being included in the stay it was delicious!

Nice rooms, clean and comfortable beds. Some with a balcony that overlooks the vulcanos and the street, which has plenty of places to eat and the Chocolate Museum ( more a shop than a museum, but you can see they making their precious chocolate). .Lovely breakfast looking at the Agua volcano, with fresh fruits, fresh orange juice, eggs and platanos ( a kind of banana that is fried, delicious). We celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary in Antigua and the owners gave us a nice bouquet of flowers and delicious gourmet chocolates (a must in Guatemala). We had our stay here in two parts, in the middle we went to the Atitlan Lake region, which is gorgeous. However, when I came back from', 'We loved the location of this hotel.  It is an easy walking distance to the Central square, and Cathedral.  Staff is super friendly and helpful.  Rooms were small but clean and with everything you need.  There is an amazingly green plant filled inner courtyard, typical of colonial structures that is cool and welcoming with a huge fountain.  There is also a rooftop terrace that has the most amazing views of Antigua, the volcanoes, everything! The only disappointment was that the booking website we used advertised a pool, and there is none.  Guests can use a pool at another hotel for a fee, but they could have disclosed that.  Overall a great stay.', 'A little overpriced perhaps - Q350 - this was on a Friday through Sunday - but a little nice room, well kept and very clean; charming, decent utilities in general. Shower a little underpowered but suffice.  Very nice roof  terrace with perfect view of volcano aqua, fuego and acanetengo.  Shared kitchen that’s well equipped; a nice lady who spoke English which is always so helpful if you are a dufus like me.  WiFi ok, occasionally drops out. Not high speed, though.  Overall, I’d recommend as the location is excellent with some benefits of sister hotels nearby added.', \"The staff were wonderful. The girls on the desk could not have been more helpful. But it was a horribly noisy place to stay. Intermittent machinery noises throughout night due to something in courtyard. Also because rooms are around courtyard/garden, people sit there or talk there and it's noisy at night. Rooms are nice but it seems there are better places to stay in price range.\", \"On the plus side, this hotel is conveniently located near the center of Antigua. Many businesses around. They keep it clean and the employees try to make you feel good.  On the negative side, rooms are packed in this small location, and you can easily hear outside noises all night. If someone gets in late, you will listen to every word they say. The coffee maker outside my room kept making noises all night.  I can't recommend this place to anyone who's a light sleeper.  \", 'Fantastic boutique and historical hotel. Here is the deal...it deserves 5 stars because of its potential and its abundant  character but will not get 5 stars because one has to sacrifice certain creature comforts like AC (it has fans) and older restrooms. But this was one of the oldest buildings in Antigua! The ceilings are like staying in a museum...just stunning. The beds are just what you need and the entire staff is fantastic.  Excellent location.  I could not recommend this hotel night. Especially for larger parties that can book in advance several of their rooms. The courtyard is beautiful and quaint.

My only complaint is that we did not have any hot water over the 3 nights we stayed at this property.  We complained about it on several occasions and the hotel tried to fix it (but only after the second complaint), and ultimately could not fix it.   Not a big issue given that it was pretty warm outside when we stayed, but want to point out the issue.', 'We definitely enjoyed our stay here. Authentic Antigua! For sure. Which means..very old structure/building, decent facilities, food. Super friendly workers. Reasonable, super-convenient Guatemala City airport pickup. Rooms are fine. Seem like refurbished horse stables..but that is selling it low. Awesome courtyards, and even awesome-er views of volcanos from the roof. Craft brewery/restaurant across the street.

The Posada is within walking distance of a lot of the restaurants, bars, and the market of Antigua.   The staff working at both Posadas are really helpful, and will cater to your need were you to have any.   The people here are really warm, and for the price, I felt I got a great deal.', \"The rooms are really small, the lady at the front desk was really rude with me and my family. The only good think was the boy that stays at night in the front desk that was really nice, but for the rest we didn't enjoyed our time there. \", \"I Always came to Posada de San Jeronimo because the service was nice and the hotel was clean. These days the service changed alot and i didn't feel welcome. Prices changed as well since three months.

I have found swarms going in a bottle of water which had no sugar. I find them everywhere I have had the housekeeper clean and bug spray the room to no avail. When I reported it, the responses instinctively sounded rehearsed/ automatic which made clear this was a pre-existing problem. The staff always did the best they can to resolve it. Once I had dinner indoors within minutes my takeaway box was swarmed with tiny ants. Pretty gross. Also when I checked in there was multiple blonde hairs in one of the bed. The other had stains. It was obvious beds were made but sheets were not cleaned. Blankets are just folded but smell like not cleaned in a long time. They should wash blankets per guest. I really love this place.

Only thing is, there is no restaurant, but many good ones very close by. (Room 302 is the best.) situated very close to parque centro, the market and of course pollo campero. Great breeze for afternoon nap. Locked gate and door at night. Coffee bar across the street Espeessart is great. Free cup of coffee if you buy a bag. Great place for semana Santa.

The free WiFi was terrible and often cut out or there was such a weak signal. The bed was hard as a rock and when we asked for an extra pillow they said they didn't have any more. The walls are paper thin and you can hear your neighbors talk, sneeze, or use the restroom. There are other places in Antigua that are the same price with higher quality. The staff was always very friendly though.   I will not be staying here again \", \"A delightful colonial style villa with well kept gardens in this delightful city of Antigua, Guatemala.

We have breakfast included in our stay, which has not been to my standard, but Victor has really been great at trying to please. The restaurant food is very average.

Pleasant bedrooms and decent sized bathroom. Friendly staff. The breakfasts however are terrible even the Sunday one which is bigger. The scrambled eggs are barely cooked and the refried beans are terrible. The fried plantain are greasy and the fresh fruit was mushy. The coffee was fine though.', 'Antigua overall is much lovelier than the city.  The service and food here was good. Unfortunately the wifi was pretty bad - my room (111) was a complete dead zone.  I could only use the wifi in the reception/dining area if I needed to use my phone/iPad. The view of the volcano is nice.  My room was clean, except the floor, and I was missing a washcloth. Be prepared for some noise while sleeping - someone near me was leaving early and his/her rolling bag on the cobblestones woke me up. No A/C or heat - I slept with the windows open (in February).', 'We really loved this hotel, the only slight downside being that the room was small with not much space for our things. BUT everything else made up for that. The quirky stepping stones over water to our room (no.6) was a great touch! The room was extremely well equipped with fridge, water each day, excellent & plentiful toiletries, coffee machine. The cosy little lounge has complementary hot drinks always available and if not hot enough, the super- friendly staff are always on hand to make more. The lovely Melvin and young woman whose name I didn’t get were especially helpful. Tiny garden with plunge pool & lovely roof terrace are great. Use of sister hotel Porta was a bonus too, and the location just 5 mins walk from the main square, shops & restaurants was quite perfect. Highly', 'This is a very cute and charming boutique hotel. Staff were very kind, professional and helpful. Perks about this hotel are that breakfast is included and you can use all the amenities of Porta Hotel just a block away.  We stayed one night with my daughter in the upper terrace room, but sadly had a rough night sleeping through because of all the noise from the streets below. This should have been notified to us beforehand, since receptionist agreed that it was very noisy room and this complaint was common. We were disappointed with the value of the room and the lack of rest.   Perhaps staying in another room on the bottom floor and further back would have been a more pleasant experience.', 'Stayed 2 nights in early April 2019. Property is impeccably well maintained and clean. Small hotel and facilities. Reasonably private and saw few other guests. Suite room was spacious but not particularly luxurious. Location was reasonably central, there is some noise from buses/trucks but by no means loud. However, I felt for the price there are many similar options in Antigua.', 'So the last night there we had a security guard try and come in assuming we were drunk or something and get in the room with 2 girls touching them inappropriately. He was asked to leave and he did for a few minutes but tried coming back with 3 additional guys to get in the room. They eventually gave up but such a horrible experience specially from the overnight guard.', \"We stayed here for 4 nights. Our room was basic and clean.

The kitchen upstairs was pretty basic - didn't end up using, but ask at front desk (we asked for wine opener and they had).\", \"Tasty coffee! Very pleasant and helpful staff. They help with the shuttles.  The location is great, easy to find, close to Cerro, 10min walk to the centre and in a quiet area. Don't worry, it's safe!  Actually there's no volcano view from the property, but it's the first thing you see when you go out. There's a small parking, I suppose it's free for guests. Warm shower only at low water pressure. Average breakfast (chapin, traditional).  If you want to take a shuttle you should know that it's more than probable that you'll be the first in the bus. Great, you can choose your seat... In return be prepared for 30min cobbled road ride to collect all the passengers from other hotels. If you are late, they'll probably come back in 30 mins ;)\", \"We moved here from a lovely but far less functional hotel.  The location is great, the rooms are comfortable and everything works as it should.  No problem with hot water.  The price is reasonable for Antigua--we find bang for the buck to be much higher generally in Mexico, but... you're in Antigua!  Breakfast was included and adequate.  Staff friendly and helpful...out of a gazillion hotels in Antigua this appears to be a reliable option, and we would return.  Cannot recommend the shuttle van their lobby travel agent booked us on to Lake Atitlan--they put 13 in an 8 person van, a hellish 3 hour ride with no potty break!

But had boxed cereal, fruit, rolls, jam, yogurt, your choice of eggs, home fries, one day pancakes, they had a travel agent at the desk & were knowledgable about the attractions & the area.

This was despite our room being reserved and paid for in full for at least 2 months previous. We were told that they were upgrading us to their other property the Euro Maya Suites where the rooms were nicer apparently, after a quick check online I found out that to stay at the Euro Maya Suites it was indeed a little bit more expensive. BUT the reason I booked the Euro Maya was more for the location and the rooftop terrace which the other one didn't have. The girl on reception was very nice to us and did give us a small discount on an excursion to the Pacaya Volcano, the room at the suites was a lovely room and we had a great time in Antigua\", 'We so much enjoyed staying here. Every corner of the small intimate hotel was gorgeously decorated, its staff courteous and helpful. Breakfast was at its delightful courtyard, and they provide free drinks/tea in the afternoon. They have a good size rooftop seating area with an amazing view of the surrounding active volcanoes. Memorable stay.', 'Very Good Hotel. The staff was amazing. They will do anything to make your stay wonderful. Good breakfast, the rooms are big and comfortable, and a very good value. The only draw back is that you can not get internet in your rooms due to the large walls, but you can get internet in the beautiful gardens.', \"Through luck of the draw, we ended up with a huge 2 room suite. The rooms were amazing and we loved it. Access to many of the attractions of Antiqua is excellent. The WiFi signal was weak and worked best in the courtyard.  But the courtyard is so beautiful you'll want to spend time there anyway.\", 'The staff at this hotel was very friendly and knowledgeable. We asked for a restaurant that was close by and \"economically priced\" (i.e. cheap) they recommended Rincon Tipico (was great btw). The room was cute and clean but the bathroom wasn\\'t so great. The shower stall and toilet are separate and the doors are flimsy. Taking a shower was difficult because the water kept leaking out.   I never saw or are at the breakfast buffet (as described). Didn\\'t know it existed. The staff refered us to a restaurant next door.   The pool is not heated as described, either.  Aside from that, the service waa great and the views are incredible.

We had booked to stay at Hotel Antigua but apparently there was an issue with our room, and no others available, so they moved us here. We were in a nice spacious Triple room (1 double, and 2 singles) with a fan (no ac) but it was cool in the evenings so a fan was adequate. The room did get quite stuffy though so we had to open the windows whenever we were in the room to air it. The shower was luke warm and would quickly lose the hot water, but still had good pressure. The various receptionists we saw during our 4 nights here spoke very little English but luckily we didn’t really need to speak to them much ! No breakfast included so you have to head out for food.

But it did occasionally', 'Pros- fantastic location, nice courtyard and roof terrace and kitchen was great as we could make our own breakfast   Cons- unfortunately none of that really mattered because the walls of the hotel rooms were so thin that we barely slept. As guests came back to the hotel during the night you could hear everything so clearly it was impossible not to be awoken. It finally got quiet around 1.30 am only for the  noise to start again around 3am as guests woke up presumably for early morning pick ups and hikes. For us it was too expensive for failing to provide decent sleep.   In addition the WiFi was really poor most of the time. Finally they provided free coffee but the coffee was rubbish and cups tasted of chlorine- small things but generally really disappointing. Would recommend', \"I stayed for 3 weeks as a solo female traveler. Positive: This hotel/ apartments look just like their photos.  They are nice looking...very cozy inside.  Housekeeping was very good but never came when they said they were coming and security was there. The beds were very very comfortable and their was good hot water.  There is a safe in the room which was great, but not sure if you could fit a full sized lap top in it.  For my I-pad it was perfect.  Wireless access was pretty reliable.  Even when I lost access it came back quickly.  Negative:  It's very noisy.  If no-one is on either side of you, it's okay, otherwise you hear everything.

As Posada offered this option and had availability - I booked - it was a GREAT DECISION.  The airport arrival can be overwhelming with the many taxi drivers lurking, and hoards of people waiting to welcome their family members. Our driver has a big clear sign and was an absolute delight!   The drive to Antigua is around 45 mins from the airport.

For our 24 hour stay in Antigua, this hotel did the job but will not be too memorable.', \"There were 3 of us sharing a room. Each had our own bed. It was clean and basic. The bathroom was a tight fit with only the one mirror. To get hot water, do not turn the pressure on too high.

The reality is that the rooms are very dirty, it looked like my floor has not been cleaned in a long time. The bathroom was also bad and no hot water, eventually a bit warm but still a freezing shower. It is also very noisy because it's by the main street.

It's a bit of a walk from the city center (far NE corner of the area where most tourists roam), but definitely not an issue.  Christian and his staff were very accommodating and a pleasure to talk to.  Since part of the hotel is set up like a hostel, there is no shortage of conversation in the outside common area with interesting guests.  I enjoyed watching a local artist paint wall murals near the bunk rooms.  There's also a beautiful garden near the private rooms, and you can catch a nap outside easily if so inclined.  My only issue was I had a bit of trouble keeping warm in the room at night, and would say that the rooms might not be as well insulated as you would expect when the temperature gets down\", 'My bed was so hard that my wife took the other single bed as she could not sleep on the hard double. Lucky for her as I endured multiple bed bug bites and she got away scott free. Still itching now as I write this. Expedia promised 15m2 but had a room size of thimble but the great staff sorted it next day. Thanks. Roof top is great for breakfast. Kitchen good for basic meal only. Good for the price.', \"Overall the hotel was nice and the service was great. However you do NOT want to be iin Room 101 (or I would suggest 102 or 103) as these are right by the courtyard used for breakfast (set up starts at 05:30am) also any visitors arriving or leaving during the night will wake you. Also for Room 101 the window from the hotel toilet opens out into your bathroom - again noise by anyone using it overnight. Finally if you are there on a Saturday night the live rock band playing at the pub next door is effectively the other side of the wall to this room. We asked to be moved but were told there weren't any suitable rooms available. This was clearly untrue as we saw rooms come and go that were suitable and in a more quite location of the hotel.   All of that said if you aren't in rooms\", 'We made a reservation for the only location listed, located just off the Calle del Arco. When we arrived, a gentleman told our driver to take us to the \"other\" location. It was a decent location. The bathrooms were nice, breakfast was good. The best was comfortable. My frustration was that it was not the location we wanted. It was further from the center. Nor was it as charming.', 'As this place is so similar to their sister property, Euro Maya Suites, you may see a lot of similarity in reviews.  I returned to Antigua and decided to try this, the older sister, as it was only half a block from The Plaza.  A beautiful small hotel with an excellent staff and nice rooms.   With all the knick-knacks around it could also be a museum. The quirky intermingling of Mezoamerican artifacts and photos of European cities is strange; depending on how you look at it you may consider it charming or annoying.  My room was above average size and comfortable although there was only one somewhat easy chair, and no sofa, so two people would have some difficulties when it came to relaxation. The bathroom was adequate and it had hot water in the shower without having bare wiring', 'There was some confusion getting here, we thought we had booked the Euro Maya Suites but ended up at this location after calling to confirm.  Ok, fine.  The room was okay, pretty cramped.  The biggest issue is not only is there no AC, but also no overhead fan and the hotel has no fans to bring it.  It was so stuff and even leaving all windows open for cross-breeze, it was really stuffy.  It was nice to have breakfast on the roof and the breakfast was super plentiful and served by lovely staff.  Location is tops.', 'Gorgeous spacious rooms, with a nice tipico breakfast included. The all day complimentary coffee, tea and purified water was very convenient to have. Centrally located.  Unfortunately the shower water was cold.  Be sure to let the front desk know if you plan to return late at night, as we were locked out, despite using the door bell and calling the front desk, exhausted, we had to find alternate accommodations in the middle of the night.  After explaining this to the staff the next morning, we were refunded the fee for the night. ', \"We spent two nights here on our way to Lake Atitlan for a service trip. The location is close to a market and the park square.  Because of the concrete design of the walls all the noises would travel up the stairwell all night long.  A lot of 20 something's stayed here and didn't seam to care about hot much noise they made all night long. The rooms were sparsely decorated and could use upgrading on the beds, bedding and pillows. The public areas were pretty. Wifi worked in our room amd the breakfast area. I wouldn't stay here again.\", 'Spent one night and would not return. The downstairs room was subjected to noisy chatter by patrons all night long and even in the early morning (0400). There is a charge for everything - wifi, water. Positive: there is a supermarket right next door. Rooms are clean. Not worth the money spent on it $65USD/2 doubles in room (just needed one).', 'we got to the hotel after overseas flight so it was great for us, but i think you can find cheaper hotel for the same quality. the location is great close to canter and to the market. ask for the first floor to get better intrnet', 'Comfortable beds with ample blankets and pillows.  A/C, cable TV, large bathroom and spacious tub/shower.  Budget priced and we got more than we could have expected for the price.  Wi-fi available.  Friendly staff.  And within an easy walk of downtown attractions and shops.', 'We stayed at this property for about 7 nights what a big mistake very old place is a dump do not waste your money bed were so hard I need to see my doctor back pain just trust me is really bad old towels loud at night there are few bars around so the noise stops at around 1:00 am the shower are very old sink are coming apart old pillows', \"My husband and I travel to Antigua about once a month for work and leisure.  We have stayed at several hotels in Antigua and have always been very pleased with staff, service and accommodations at other hotels in the area.   This hotel has been the worst we have stayed at by far in this price range.  The receptionist was accommodating but slightly rude.  Definitely not friendly or personable and the staff acted like they didn't know what they were doing most of the time.  We stayed for two nights and politely asked if it was possible to change rooms after the first night because our room was located right next to reception desk which was very noisy and loud from people checking in and out all through the day and night we could not sleep.  The first room was very comfortable and\", \"My sister and I stayed at Hotel Casa del Parque recently and we had a wonderful visit. The hotel is very centrally located, within a few steps to the central park (where many restaurants, cafe's and shops are located) and artisanal markets. The staff were very friendly and helpful, directing us to the best place to exchange money, and helped us to arrange transportation to the airport. The pool was great - very refreshing and so appreciated after a day of sightseeing. The upper level has a great view of nearby ruins and the volcano, but we had a room on the lower floor and it was still great, with a view into the courtyard filled with plants and a fountain.\", 'Friendly and helpful staff. Beautiful courtyard. Good American breakfast. Even though their English was poor managed to get everything we asked for. The only complaint - no blow dryer available....Very cooperative when asking to leave suitcase or anything else.', \"Beautiful little hotel close to Central Park. I needed some peace and quiet and chose this hotel for the beautiful rooms and courtyard. The price was quite reasonable compared to other hotels in the area. Breakfast was continental but for the price I paid I didn't expect a feast. Wifi only worked in the courtyard, the signal was too weak in my room. All in all, a great stay.\", 'This place was clean and the staff was so helpful! They helped us find places we wanted to go and gave great recommendations! So easy to walk to the main square and right by La Merced. Little noisy on streets at night but not a problem!', \"I concur with johndaunt, this hotel is a little pricey, but they offer good service, classy rooms and an historic setting.   It is just 2 blocks from the main square and there is traffic, but we kept our windows closed and weren't disturbed. We were offered a cooked, or continental breakfast (which is included in the rate) and ate on their very pretty patio.   We heard no noise from other rooms and my only gripe would be that the bedrooms need more illumination. Hopefully they could do that tastefully without breaking up the colonial decor.   If you are considering this property, be aware that they have a sister hotel called the Palacio Chico 1940, so don't book the wrong hotel. Don’t know why this property sits so low in the TA listings, it is a good option for travelers\", 'We stayed here on our final night in Antigua the staff could not have been nicer they answered loads of questions for us and sorted an airport shuttle. The room was spotless and the shuttered windows ensured a solid nights rest. It is a little expensive for what you get in terms of breakfast which was only 2 pieces of toast, 2 small slices of watermelon and pineapple. We asked for eggs which they gave.   Bottled water was free and it is in a nice quiet area of the town. ', \"- Someone broke into my room and stole cash and expensive sunglasses. - Staff did not want to help - was very reluctant to inquire staff and other customers on the incident OR call police. Staff actually tried to imply I had lost items / not locked door/ fabricated the incident. The lack of assistance was as bad as the invasion of privacy, particularly for a young solo female traveller - 'Hotel' is actually a large house with rooms rented out - Was told no one else had keys to my room but staff later admitted the owner had a key - Local authorities i.e. the tourism police are very helpful\", \"The rooms were clean and nice. However you had to walk through the kitchen to get to shower. Also the family are there daily and live there i believe. They are always in the kitchen/dining area which is also the reception... Two nights out of three we were kept up by people or children talking loudly...one of these nights was 10pm ! It is more like air bnb where you stay with family. Doesn't have feel of hotel.also the kitchen and fridge were not clean. Staff and owner are friendly. Also as advertised quite a distance from central at least 15min walk not much close by. We would not stay here again. \", \"a 15 min a pied du centre.   C est plutôt une chambre d hôte qu' un hôtel. pas de petit déjeuner, ni même de café. pas de ménage ni de changement de serviette durant le séjour. Chambre confortable et propre. personnel agréable. transfert possible depuis l aéroport (un peu cher 250 Q)\", 'Stayed at this hotel June 24-29, 2011 to attend a famly wedding in town.    The owners and staff are extremely accomodating and eager to assist.  The rooms were spacious, very clean and modern with a charming rustic flare.  The price was just right. Located in a quieter part of town.  Gated with a doorman, I felt safe and secure at all times.  I highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay here on my next trip to Antigua.', \"Our family of 2 adults and 3 kids stayed at this new hotel last month.  It has a great location of the hotel, it's within walking distance of the main plaza in a very quiet neighborhood, (also it's very close to the hotel Porta, which has a large swimming pool and a playground that non-guests can use by paying a daily fee, very convenient for our young kids!) The hotel del Marques features exclusively suites, we booked a large suite for 6 persons equipped with a kitchen,  and a washer & dryer all of which proved very useful!  The beds were new and very comfy, even the sofa-bed seemed good quality (my kids slept in it, not me though) The hotel is quiet, we couldn't hear any of the other guests, however the design of the suite is such that you'll hear from the bedroom located\", 'Sweet little hotel in the heart of downtown Antigua, Guatemala. Beautiful courtyard, sweet, tiny rooms. The beds are a bit hard, the shower took a bit to find the sweet spot, but overall enjoyed the two days spent here. We came via an Explorica tour. ', 'Clean hotel in a good location but when we checked out, the front desk clerk showed us an old ripped hand towel and said it had been found in our room and we must pay for it.  We did not rip the towel but were charged $9 for it anyway.  Will not stay here again.', 'We stayed for two night at this hotel. We had a room on the second floor. The first night we had two twin bed on the second night we were able to get a double bed in our room without changing the room which was very nice. The hot water was a little bit hard to regulate in the shower. The first night was quiet but the second night there was a big group of volunteers staying at the hotel which made a lot of noise late at night and early in the morning. The location of the hotel is very good near the central park.', 'Excellent hotel. Had a lovely outdoor eating area with small kitenette. Rooms were spacious and comfortable, bathroom was clean with good water pressure. Great central location near the main plaza, grocery store and markets. Staff spoke english well enough. We were able to book our pacaya volcano climb here for the next morning. They also book shuttles and if they dont have the specific service youre after there is a travel agent next door. The only thing that wouldve made this stay perfect would have been hot water in the shower. ', \"Not really clean hotel, smells bad and very noisy over night. It's quite close to the parque central though and the guardians were friendly.  For such price (320Q), its possible to find much better addresses in Antigua.\", 'Our room had three beds and a TINY bathroom.  It was very clean.  The room was furnished simply, but it was very adequate.  We had a lower floor room, but I think upstairs might be quieter.  There is no air conditioning, so the upper floor might be pretty warm in the summer.', 'It’s on the outside of town which means large coaches can stop here so groups like it and although at night on the whole it’s quieter than sleeping in town as it also caters for functions and we had one evening where we were disturbed by a band quite late into the night.  Add to this the tour groups arriving and departing in the nighttime hours and voices and suitcases bumping along the cobbles reverberating around the complex and it doesn’t always make for a peaceful sleep.  It looks OK on the surface and is tastefully done up to look like an old colonial town and has a nice courtyard garden area but it lacks charm or personality, the staff aren’t particularly friendly, the rooms are rather dated and certainly the ground floor ones smelt damp and needed airing, and the beds', 'I stayed for two nights with my family in late December.  The hotel setting (grounds, buildings, ambiance) is five stars and amazing.  Kudos to the hotel for improving the museums, which are really interesting and worth a visit whether or not you stay at this hotel.  However, the food and room were not too impressive- three stars.  The room smelled smoky as there was a fireplace and a little card that instructed people not to have fires... well, then maybe you should take out the wood of the fireplace so that people do not light fires!  We had two meals at the hotel- an average breakfast with very slow service and sandwiches at the pool, which were not very good. All in all, an enjoyable 2 days, but the hotel could do better.', 'It was nicely located just 5min from city. Nice to have breakfast on the rooftop. Rooms and hotel was quite nice. The service as well, they can also help you with tours. You have working wifi there too.', 'Hotel is very centric which is good but ended up awake at 3am by the sound of other room alarm and noisy guests checking out, rooms dont have any sound control plus have poor ventilation and get quite warm (no vents and no a/c).  Beds are squeaky and not that confortable.  The bathroom is horribly decorated.   Overall for the price (over 100 usd) I am sure there are better other choices.', 'The communal areas here are lovely. Grear coffee too. But the first room I got given absolutely stank of a stong chemical smell which I can only imagine is the floor cleaner. I asked to be moved, 5 minutes jn there made me nauseous. The next room also smelled old and is run down.  Road noise very loud!  The mattress doesnt have a mattress protector, the  thin  fitted sheet goes straight on the matress which is just gross. Thumbs down for me.', 'This hotel is a cosy little oasis, set in the lovely colonial town of Antigua. The courtyard within the hotel is beautiful and its landscape ; simple and yet stunning , making us feel right at home. It’s just great to be able to chill at the courtyard sipping coffee or a beer.  The staffs are all friendly and very helpful, passionate and knowledgeable. The staff helped us booked most of our activities at great prices and we are so grateful for all the tips. The rooms are big, simple and yet functional . Hot water is available but can take a few minutes to flow through the shower, so a little of patience help.  Overall this is a nice place to stay, and i would recommend checking it out.', 'This is a very nice 3 Star Hotel. Not in the center of the town, but not far from everything. Just 4 blocks away from the Main Plaza (Parque Central de la Antigua Guatemala). I would say the location, a little bit away is better to have a tranquil night. The hotel itself does not show all the beauty from the outside. There is a big wood door that is kept closed all day and night. But inside you will be presented by a huge garden very well taken care of. There is no parking. People are very attentive and always smiling. The room is very comfy, good bed, small tv that I did not try. In my room (19) there was 2 queen beds. My only complain is the shower, difficult to get to a constant water temperature. Sometimes too hot, sometimes colder. But nothing that bothered too much. I do', 'We found the staff at the hotel very friendly. The room had charm as well as all the amenities we needed. Even though our room faced the street the wood shutters kept it quiet. We loved the option of having breakfast on either the rooftop patio or at the buffet at Porto. Plus being able to use the pool at Porto was great. The location is very good. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Thanks for a nice stay!', \"The hostel is very clean, I felt like there was always someone busily cleaning throughout the day.  Maria on reception is fantastic and organised Spanish lessons for me with an awesome  private tutor that I had at the hostel.   The location is awesome. A 30 second walk to the square and loads of nice resteraunts and bars. It's not a very sociable hostel (but then I was staying in a private room).However because it is so close to lots of sociable bars (particularly the snug/ travel menu) this wasn't a problem.\", \"I spent 2 night at Hostal Antigua sleeping in the big dorm at the end of the open air corridor; the dorm is spacious enough, with comfortable beds, lockers, and direct access to clean toilets. Up the stairs, you'll find a lovely terrace where you can eat your own breakfast, as a comfortable kitchen is available! Staff was gentle and willing to book shuttles for us.\", 'Nice place for a few nights!  Dorms have comfy beds, and there is a nice patio and kitchen on the roof.  Bathrooms could be a bit cleaner, but definitely workable.  Helpful staff as well.  They provide good lockers with a key.', 'Good location, clean and nice room, but not so big. Staff was unfriendly and unhelpful - additionally not speaking English. Hostel for people who like peace and quiet. Curfew in force since 22 hours. Generally a bit expensive.', \"Charming hotel in a charming town though be mindful of the cobbled stone streets not the most user friendly surface. The hotel is central and offers only breakfast, the sticky muesli is very good, the service is a little nonchalant but you're on holiday so don't stress. There is a roof terrace which offers a nice view of the volcanoes.\", 'A lovely, quirkily elegant hotel with rooms leading off the internal courtyards and verandahs.  Our first floor room wasn’t that big, but was clean and comfortable with traditional colonial decor.  We found it quiet for sleeping at night.   The shower was really good - always a big plus for us.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is served in the beautiful courtyard full of ferns and flowers, which can be a bit chilly  (my follically challenged companion had to wear his woolly hat!) but we were told there was an unusually cold front coming through!  Not a huge choice of food, but the fruit was excellent, and the traditional breakfast of eggs, plantain, salsa and refried beans was nice.  The hotel is centrally located so it’s easy to walk to all areas of Antigua', 'Very conveniently located a block of the main plaza.  This was a first time visit to Euro Maya selected mainly on the basis of reviews on Trip Advisor.  In retrospect, it may be safe to stay a night in any given location and search for an alternative if the first night does not meet to your satisfaction.  The location is excellent, but if you are not capable of walking up a flight of steep stairs, then this place may pose a challenge for you.  The front desk help will assist you with the bags, but maybe not so much if you have a very early check out the next morning.  This is a simply furnished hotel among many similar offerings.  One thing of note, the prices had dropped considerably since I made reservations on line several months ago.  Sometimes, if you are so inclined, it', \"What a great impression this place made, on the last day of our travels. We arrived late and our daughter, who had a bad stomach, hadn't eaten and was craving a soy-milk banana smoothie (she's a New Yorker, say no more). The lovely Argentinean host ran out to the supermarket, got soy milk and delivered a delicious smoothie to our room. So kind! Our family room consisted of a pristine, spacious room with two big double beds, a smaller room with bunk beds, and a bathroom. Comfortable beds, lovely white sheets, and so conveniently located right in the center of the city. Excellent value.\", 'I have already reviewed this hotel and EuroMaya Suites, but I read some of the other reviews and I am disturbed by some peoples attitude and expectations. I have no affiliation with either Hotel do not know the owners, but I did meet one of the owners once and she was very friendly. Somebody wrote that the rooms were the size of a broom closet where my half joking complaint about the Euro Maya Suites was it was such a long walk from the Master bedroom to the washroom as room 15 is enormous and is an actual suite with a king size bed and 60 inch flat screen for $50 US, Yes the rooms at the Euro Maya Hotel are smaller but they do charge less. to the reviewer that arrived on December 30th and complained about bait and switch, You arrived the day before New years Eve, you were lucky', \"This is our 3 visit to this hotel in the past few years. Can't beat the central location, 1 block from the main square. The hotel is nice and quiet for such a central spot. All the rooms open onto a central courtyard.  We stayed on the second floor - room 5 and my sister and Husband in Room 4. Room 5 had a double and single bed, Room 4, one queen sized bed. The beds with very comfortable with nice bedding and good pillows. Lovely flat screen TV's with Sky TV, so many many channels in English. Good, high speed internet. Not the strongest signal in our room, but excellent in the central courtyard.  A rooftop deck with some fabulous views. Not much furniture for sitting up on the roof deck.  The price included breakfast - traditional fare - eggs, beans, cheese, plantain, and toast.\", 'Shared a room with 2 friends, we were satisfied so we decided to stay in this hostel for all our nights. The room was not expensive and the breakfast included was very good, we even had a choice of breakfast.', 'The location was perfect, right around the corner from the market and grocery store. The employees were great and courteous. The rooms were ok, nothing grand or special, typical Guatemalan hotels. Old looking inside etc...The rooms were hot though. I had to ask for a second fan because it felt like a sauna inside, while the temperature was cool outside. The WIFI was great on the 1st floor, not so great on the 3rd deck patio. It is cheap, but they charge by the day on WIFI. A disappointment for the cost of the hotel, it should be included. The lowere level has a dining/living room area with a fountain that is nice to chill. The patio is nice as well with great views and lots of seating.', \"We enjoyed our time here and the place was very clean with good sized rooms. There is a nice roof terrace where you can sit and enjoy the views. There's a kitchen you can use if you want. Some people in reviews complained about it being noisy, this was not an issue for us.\", \"We were happy to find a pet-friendly hotel a few blocks from the main plaza so we were able to visit a lot of Antigua landmarks with our small dog. Rooms are spacious and clean. Other than that, this hotel was overpriced and noisy.

Has a supermarket two door down and a small kitchen where you can cook and store food. Has a lovely roof top terrace with great views. Staff are all friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean and spacious.   Negatives - there is no free wifi! This was a real sticking point for me, as the hotel advertises free wifi, yet you have to pay Q20 every 24 hours for the wifi code, which they will type into your device so you can't share it with others. They also turned off the internet each night at 8pm and it didn't come back on again until 8am. This was very disappointing as we needed the internet to help plan our trip and activities. Also, like most people said, choose\", 'This is a cute hotel with a lot of character with great staff and a wonderful location.  It includes breakfast and is only a few steps from one of the main squares.  The main issue some people may have with it is the fact that it is next door to a club / night club so the noise level may be a bit much for any rooms on the one side of the hotel with rooms farther away still close enough to \"hear\" the music / beat of the club.', \"Nice staff but not worth the money.  I made a mistake of prepaying for the room to get some discount, however I end up paid the penalty to checked out early and move to different hotel. My wife and I stayed for four nights.

Hot shower, wifi was good, the desk clerk girl was very sweet and helpful. Very reasonably priced, and close to the center.

Anyway - is you are there to see the city is is at perfect place for only a few days.', 'This hotel was a great place to stay in Antigua. It was central to everything, the park, markets, restaurants and bars. It has  the old colonial feel to it. The beds and pillows comfortable, great WiFi, hot water, free drinking water, free coffee and tea. Beer for sale in cooler, cheap price. Nice courtyard and a top terrace with great views. Very secure. The best though is the staff was very friendly and helpful. The only down side, is that the terrace needs new cushions for chairs and to be more inviting, so much potential there. We would definitely stay there again. Oh ya and they store your stuff for you if you are coming back as we did after spending a week at Lago de Atitlan.', 'I was hoping to stay at another smaller hotel but it was fully booked for the dates we wanted so we ended up staying here.

The hotel was nice, but would not have been my first choice due to lack of amenities. Especially given that we were hiking, biking, and kayaking, I would prefer somewhere with a pool or hot tub.   The room was clean and comfortable.  Clean bath towels daily, but only one hand towel and one wash cloth for 3 people.   The package had us away for two nights out of the week. The hotel staff charged $1 per bag for storage, which is ridiculous. They coordinate with the tour operator for the cost of the room, and knew we would be out for two separate nights, and still charged us. The menat the front desk were apologetic.  The woman was prickly and borderline rude. I told them we would pay all charges at checkout, but they asked for the', 'Awesome base in Antigua. Really close to the city square, great pubs and food and very easy to navigate around.   The view on the rooftop at night was my favourite! To sit upstairs and be able to see Volcan de Fuego erupting was a real treat.

The rooms are clean, comfortable and there is a laundry service at the hotel (also very expensive compared to local rates)', 'Stayed here on two occasions and in both cases it was a perfect base in Antigua. The suites are about 5 blocks from the central square of Antigua - walking along cobbled streets. Its in a quiet part of town with all rooms on two levels surrounding a very pleasant internal courtyard.

The rooms are reasonable size with good facilities - a great shower and bed. We did not have breakfast included so went out each morning (there are some great options nearby.

We originally had a room by the roadside and it was a bit noisy in the early morning, but we were able to change rooms given it was low season. The hot water works, but requires a bit of patience. Bottled water provided daily was appreciated. The location was good - walking distance to Parque Central and Caobo Farm.

The great thing though was breakfast. It's on the terrace which has remarkable views of volcanoes and the food was delicious \", 'The hotel is nice, the beds are not comfortable but the pillows are. It has a lovely garden in the center with tables for you to drink tea or coffee.  It is pet friendly, they don’t charge anything extra for your pet and they give you a little bed for them.   Bathroom inside the room and a little TV. The hotel isn’t quiet, the noise starts around 5am and that kept our puppy up since.  If you call the hotel they’ll give you a cheaper price than if you book your trip online (around Q200 or $20 cheaper)', 'Our previous accommodation bailed on us last minute so we had to find a quick plan B.

The clerk told us the night before that breakfast was from 7 thru 10 am and they were having buffet.  Surprise! My wife went @7:20 (before her salon appointment) for the “buffet” and they told her the buffet was over (only two guest were sitting in the dining area).  I woke up later and went @8:15 to the front desk and they told me the buffet was served from 7-8am!!! So they gave me a menu with 3 options for $6.

I stayed here with my family for a week. While the lady was fine with negotiating while staying within a reasonable range, she removed breakfast from the service, also fine. There was also no laundry service (at least for us). What was not fine was that she was not welcoming during our stay and I felt as if she hovered over us the entire time. I caught her peeking at me through the window as I was leaving the kitchen area. I noticed she was pretty rosy with the other guests though. We were not a noisy/messy bunch and remained polite the entire time so I'm not sure what the issue was, but i really couldn't wait to leave.

We were literally told we were out unless we agreed to pay their revised price. Highly unprofessional. They made the mistake and yet they tried to make us pay for it. On top of that, they delayed telling us leaving us even less choice with where to go on a very popularly booked week of the year in Guatemala. Any hotel worth its salt would never do this imho. Book at your peril.', \"A nice hostel for those who want a quiet place with a relaxing atmosphere and home feeling. Have a small roof top terrace with look to Fuego Vulcano.

Great location convenient to all La Antigua has to offer.  Room was clean and had all the common amenities/touches of U.S. hotels.

We were greeted within 30 seconds by the Owner/Operator named Christian, and he is the nicest guy in town. The atmosphere of the Hostel was definitely more relaxed the first night (Thursday), and the crowd picked up for the Friday/Saturday nights. However, it’s definitely NOT a typical “party“ Hostel. They do have a wide selection of cheap and delicious beers, and it’s a great vibe for hanging out but we always got a great night sleep as it tends to quiet down around 1030-11. Rooms were very clean with a big hot shower, and the beds were very comfy. Highly recommend this accommodation!', 'Stayed in a room with a private bath. It was clean and comfortable, with plenty of hot water. They have a great outdoor area to relax. The staff was extremely helpful with transportation needs.  Thanks to Christian and the staff!', 'Nice staff, great location, hot showers and nice roof top. Safe lockers.  The kitchen desperately needs a range of sharp knives! And butter knives.  12 person dorm was noisy, buy what do you expect!   Would stay again if they had the smaller dorms available.

I had over 80 in total and my partner had about half that. We were in the private room so I'm sure the dorm rooms are fine.  Christian at the front desk was very helpful and found us a new hotel and we thank him for that. The hotel did not reimburse or compensate us in any way.

I hope management resolves this issue for future travellers as it's a lovely, conveniently located Hostel. \", 'What a great find! On the main drag between the arch and the main square, is this tiny gem. Our room was clean and comfortable, and we loved the common space. The breakfasts were the best we had in a week in Guatemala! And Maria even came early one day to make us breakfast before an early departure. The hosts were pleasant and accommodating and willing to make recommendations. The only challenge was evening noise on the outside room; the inside ones are quieter. But there is no way to get this location without some noise, and for us the location was perfect. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!', 'Hotel is centrally located so accessing the landmarks in Antigua is easy on foot. Hotel is old style charm but not in the luxury category. Could do with some updating but was comfortable enough although if our room had only one double bed we would have had a lot more room.

Being an old restored Spanish-style house, it's possible to access to a central courtyard with good ventilation, at least from some rooms. The service is very good and the breakfast too. However, some aspects are not good, for example the outside noise, because the hotel is very close to the street and the external noises of public transportation are heard from early in the morning. I also heard every day a cock crowing at 5 am, but that was rather funny for me. While the rooms are big, the bathrooms are small and the shower is very uncomfortable.

The first room was fine although obviously cheaper. The next morning the staff said our room was booked and we needed to move to another room. This room was even cheaper, smaller, had no windows and was right next to the front desk. As a result, we ended up in a $20 room. Posada Don Valentino lied to us and stole our money.

My two big complaints: 1) If you get a room along the hallway close to the reception desk, it will be IMPOSSIBLE to sleep. The walls are paper thin and you can hear the receptionists chatting, guests checking in and out. It felt like people were yelling as they were stomping up and down the hallway.

If you look at the websites, the same pictures are used and mostly feature Casa Rustica.

We paid $30 for a night, and had a large room with private bath and two beds. It had a TV, but i cant really say cable was included because the signal was awful (but who is really in Antiga to watch tv?!). Wifi here is best accessible from the main living area.

The whole floor was ankle deep in water and extended out to the courtyard. Our nights sleep was disturbed and our luggage on the floor was soaking wet. The manager refused to reimburse us or provide some discount for our bad experience. From a customer care perspecrive the hotel was run very poorly.

With more guests', 'I just stayed here with my family in November and I absolutely LOVED this place.  The rooms are so nice, with huge flat screen tvs, amazing showers, and comfortable beds.  It has an excellent atmosphere and included breakfast.  It is close to everything, and super clean.  The only complaint is that we could hear some noise on the street in the morning, but that was completely overshadowed by how wonderful our room was.  We had a two story loft, and it was gorgeous.  I am from Guatemala City but live in the U.S., I would definitely recommend this hotel.  Great prices and overall wonderful stay.', 'We have stayed here many times. Always treated like family by Luis (owner) and Hugo (#1 back up to Luis) and Clara (housekeeping and more). This was one of our longest stays (7 nights). We were treated to an eruption by the volcano Fuego. About 11 miles distant and the wind was in our favor. Great viewing from the roof. The place is as eclectic as always. Very reasonable. Close to central square (1-1/2 blocks). Convenient to most everything else.', 'Greetings all!  Here it is in a nutshell.  Overpriced.  Room too small to accommodate a single persons luggage.  No place to hang clothes.  One spigot of cold water in the sink.  Spider on my towel, on removing it the rack fell to the floor.  Room  behind kitchen bad due to chatty cooks at 6 am.  Today second day, loud music at 6 am.  No rest for the weary.  Minimal breakfast offered so ate out.  Staff good!  For the money you can do much better!  Try Hotel San Jorge, cheaper, and much better.  Would not stay here again.  If not for lost luggage by United, delivered 44 hours after arrival, I would have moved. Mosquitoes in room.  No screens on window.', 'As you enter the courtyard, you are assailed by a collection of plants, pictures, memorabilia, and icons.  It is visually fascinating to walk around this hotel.  Antiques and oddities are perched harmoniously though the halls, up the stairs, and out to the roof top patio.  The communal kitchen is clean, and cozy.  The rooms were super quiet and spacious - and the restrooms were spotless with lovely hot water!  We had a small balcony where we could peek out at the stars...', \"I stayed there on December 27 and 28, 2013.  It's a very small hotel and that was one of the reasons we wanted to stayed there.  We were 30 of us so we rented the whole hotel , but when we got there they had only 5 out the 7 rooms reserved for us. We should of known then that it wasn't going to be a good experience.  The rooms were not what they said and advertise in the internet, one of the rooms had no running water so the bathroom was not working , none of the rooms had potable water other rooms had no tv in total they were not to the quality we were expecting. The worst part the hotel is being run by a Colombian woman maned ROCIO who has no business ethic she plain stole money from us by asking us for more money when we complained about the lack of services and such. It is\", 'we had a great stay here for one night.  good location, friendly staff and a hotel with lots of character and a lovely central courtyard.  price was good value and included breakfast continental style.  recommend it.', 'I spent one night in La Antigua, upon arrival in spite  of having made reservations for a room with two queen beds I had to pay for an extra room because the hotel does not have rooms with two queen beds. Having a print out of my reservation that clearly stated my request and confirmation was useless. The restaurant is not very good.', \"Rooms are very clean but small, bathroom is split into three (shower, sink and WC) where a built in wardrobe would have been, making it impossible to have privacy. Bar next door hosts a karaoke night during the week, this continues until the early hours and with poor induration and no double glazing we were up till 1am. Pool doesn't have many loungers and can be very loud when families are around. Great view of the volcanos makes up for the 3 star review.\", \"We stayed here with two children aged 6 and 10, and we had a lovely time.  It's a small place and not overly luxurious, but the gardens are beautiful, the location is perfect, the staff was very helpful, and the room was very comfortable.  Breakfast by the pool with a view of the volcano in the background was a perfect way to start each day.  The pool is small and a little chilly, but the kids still enjoyed it.The shower wasn't great, either the water pressure or the drainage, but that wasn't a big deal.  The only real problem, as others have said, was the noise.  Weeknights were just fine, but the one weekend night we were there it was even worse than I had imagined, and we had a second floor room away from the street. We closed all our room windows, used our phones as white\", 'Excellent location and service overall.  I enjoyed the daily breakfast that was available when you wanted it.   Only downside is that the room itself lacked privacy (thin walls) and the church bells every morning (early) were a bit annoying.  It is a small price to pay for a great location.', \"We spent three nights here.  While it was okay, it was not what was promised in its write up.  If there was a gallery, it's long gone.  So is the wine tasting and sales and so is the breakfast, which is included, but served at a coffee shop three doors down.  The mattress was in need of  replacement, sheets and towels were clean and newer. One can see that at one time, it had a lot of promise but money or enthusiasm has waned in it's maintenance.\", \"I have stayed at this Hotel three times. Each time I was with a large group (18 people). The rooms were clean, everything was in walking distance and they were very friendly. I have thought about going to another Hotel when I return next year but I won't because I love this one.\", \"Very friendly staff that are knowledgeable of the area, and will help out with any questions you have. Rooms are barebones, which is perfect if you just need a place to clean up and sleep like I did. Right around the corner from central park and the market. The only real downside is a large group that came in and kept slamming their doors whenever they left. Some kind of door dampers installed would be a great way to cut out the noise from rowdier neighbors. Aside from that, I didn't hear any noise from the local clubs/parties going on.\", 'This hotel has a friendly staff who can help with your questions about getting around Antigua. This is a big plus if you are on your first trip to Antigua. It is very close to parque central and many other highly visited areas. We found the room to be basic and clean but very noisy.  This hotel is also used for a language school so there were many young people there.', 'We received a small room on the first floor with private bath. Pretty basic but nice enough. Rooms have a window facing the hall that let in all the outside noise. We were woken up multiple times by loud guests.  Has a nice courtyard, dining area and lounge area.', 'Comfortable hotel at a fair price. Rooms are clean and adequate. The hotel feels very secure and it in a good location - between the market and the main square, with many restaurants just around the corner. Fast wifi and a strong signal in the rooms. This is a good choice for couples looking for a nice place to crash in Antigua.', \"We were there last month and we thought its location was great. Just a short five minute walk from the Mercado de Artesanias and from the famous arch. The hotel itself is small. The rooms are of decent size. The bathrooms definitely need a little attention. They don't have a parking area, but they did recommend a parking area at another hotel that was also a short walk away.  The service was nice and friendly. We arrived late and went in and out a couple of times during the night and they were always ready to see if we needed any help.   Pros: Excellent location Friendly service Great wifi connection (better than other wifi connections in Guatemala)  Cons: Bathrooms No parking  I would stay here again :) \", 'We booked 5 out of the 8 rooms for our group and we had a blast! The staff is very nice and the rooms are adequate and very clean. The courtyard on ground floor served as our \"living room\". We would all sit down there and visit in the evenings and mornings. The had a refrig to store food in and we had use of a toaster oven and microwave oven. It was perfect for our group! Every morning the volcano had a different look and my daughter took a picture of it daily! We stayed upstairs and would leave our windows and door open to let the air flow through.', \"We stay only for 1 night and ran away from this bad place. The girl in the front desk promised us a hot water, but it wasn't right. The water was ice cold!! The room was dirty, the sheets and towels were stained and we had a huge spider in the room. Plus, it was noisy at night due to a bar next door. We had a terrible night and run away in the morning. For this amount of money (32$ per night and in weekend even More!!) you better looking for another place.\", 'We have enjoyed our visits lately to Hotel Posada San Vicente...good rates, clean rooms, hot showers and very close to all things good in town.  The roof deck provides a wonderful panoramic view of the city, especially at sunrise and sunset!!', 'We stayed 5 nights here. The rooms are quaint but the courtyard a bit noisy. The hotel hosted several large groups. My parents had to change rooms to accommodate other people. Their second bed was \"itchy\" but I hate to speculate why. Access to the kitchen was useful for leftovers. Terrace had great 360 views of the city and volcanos, including the very active El Fuego. ', \"We were disappointed with Posada San Vincente - for what we were paying we really expected much better.  Hot water was limited and not really ever properly hot. The courtyard is very noisy. Rooms are small and not well ventilated. There were two small soaps but the place doesn't even supply shampoo. We just felt like we were constantly getting ripped off by the place.  We booked the airport transfer and we drove around picking people up at their respective hotels and waiting for guests to arrive from other transfers for 1 hour and 15 minutes before we actually got on the road to the airport so make sure you leave a wide margin of time.  The wifi did work fine for us and the rooftop terrace is nice for the view.\", 'I spent a few nights at this hotel recently, and it was a perfect home base for our time in Antigua. It was a short walk to most of the main tourist sites and near a great grocery store. The hotels courtyard is truly lovely and brimming with healthy plants. Kudos to the gardener!  Our double room was on the 2nd floor, and it was simple and clean. Daily housekeeping did a great job. My favorite thing about this hotel is the rooftop terrace - The 360 views of the volcanoes are amazing. Agua, Fuego and Acatenango are easily visible (if the weather is clear) and there is a nice view of Saint Joseph Cathedral as well. A perfect spot to enjoy a relaxing afternoon break from exploring.   Everyone on staff was friendly and welcoming. The only criticism I have is that there was little', 'We visit the place a couple w 2 small kids. Arrived late. We asked before the hotel to stay on the ground floor. When we came at midnight with two sleeping kids from the airport. The guy insist to put us on 2nd floor. No elevator. He insist there is no room down. What was wrong. After I insist to be on the ground floor, as I ask few days before he gave us this small room.  I liked the yard and the location. Shower Ammm what to say. Funky head and not really hot. In general Beautiful small yard. Central place. The room very small. But clean. Most of the team lovey. Tv old style.  And can be noisy from the room around. ', 'It’s an ok hostel. It’s a little tired in places and sadly not the cleanest. I had to change beds as I woke up with bites after the first night.   The kitchen is alright and has pots and pans. Cutlery and plates are a little battered and the lack of good cleaning products means that people can’t / don’t really clean things thoroughly.   It has a good social vibe and nightly events. Good for tours and shuttles.   We stayed somewhere else on our way back through Antigua. ', \"I booked here specifically because I was told it was quiet. When I saw my room was far from the busy street noise outside I figured it would be a good nights sleep. Unfortunately the BLARING TV was on until 10:30pm then turned back on at 7AM. It was an exceptionally unpleasant way to wake up. When I went to complain at the front desk I saw there were actually 2 TV's on and no guests were present! I got the girl at reception to turn off 1, but she seemed like she could have cared less and went back to watching her show.  Then I go to order the free breakfast (burned pancakes, no butter, gross marmalade, ) & they have ....techno blaring in the garden. Sorry, but I paid extra to get a nice experience not to hear some random TV commercials and your terrible music. The room was fine.\", \"Nice place. Clean and very spacious. Comfortable beds, hot showers and free breakfast. Nice TV lounge and helpful staff. The dorms only have 6 beds in them and so are nice. Around are several stores for food and drink and restaurants. It is a 5 minute walk to the Central Park. It's about an easy 10 minute walk to the public bus park and market. Free WiFi. Thoroughly recommended.\", 'I have to be honest I was expecting a bit more based on the photos and description, but we still had a comfortable 2 night stay here. The photos must have been taken some time ago as the rooms are now a bit tired (dirty carpet, mould on walls and dead mosquitoes squashed on walls).  However, the courtyard is nice and they have a parrot by reception too! Nice location on a quiet street but only a 5 minute walk from the main square. Breakfast isn’t included though as it states on here, it is extra. Free coffee and drinking water was nice though! ', \"This is not a good choice.....i was put into a room next to a gate where they had ppl going back and forth with all kinds of equipment etc.   It was scary....also...the girl at the desk could not get off the cell phone to pay any attention to any guests.....just a crappy hotel....far from the center and has nothing to offer....at all.....don't bother folks.....you're better off in a hostel.....lol\", 'Lovely garden and roof terrace with a great view. Kind and friendly staff. Very good bed. The room gets cleaned every day. Not the best shower, but warm which was nice. Breakfast is okay. Location is great! ', 'We stayed here three nights in total. One night in the ground floor where the room was rather chilly and two nights on 1st floor which was much nicer. There is a lot of traffic noise. But the location is good and facilities good. The breakfast is excellent 30 Qz  ie £3 a eggs benedict with cheese and ham ,granola, yogurt, fresh fruit a roll and toast and unlimited coffee. For us the added bonus was the view of Volcano del Fuego emiting smoke and larva and Yolanda giving us a Spanish lesson . A good experience. ', 'There are loads of lovely alternatives so this is not somewhere you need to stay !    As with other reviews , the noise is unbelievable across the Central open  Courtyard !  The rooms are incredibly basic and bare light bulbs !   The staff are disinterested and unhelpful   There are so many nice places to stay in Antigua this is not one of them ! ', 'The exterior spaces are nice but the rooms are very basic and I’d struggle to say anything nice about them. It’s a little further out of the town so I’d say it’s better to spend a few extra dollars for a better location.', 'We stayed here for 4 nights in Dec 2017. Hotel staff friendly & welcoming, the staff spoke English & appreciated my efforts to speak Spanish! Hotel is in a quiet location but neat the main plaza, lovely courtyard. Breakfast served on the roof  terrace by attentive staff, breakfast was lovely. Fabulous views from roof terrace, especially when a volcano in the distance began to  emit smoke/ash...very exciting ! Rooms clean but fairly basic. Hot water does take a while to come through in the shower....so wait!! If needed, the hotel can arrange for your laundry to be done for you if you are there for a couple of days.', \"I just stayed one night.  The location is good - six blocks from the central plaza and very quiet.  The free breakfast is decent and the large courtyard is nice.  The showers are cold, however, despite having electric shower heads (I talked to others and they couldn't get hot water, either).  Antigua mornings can be chilly and a cold shower was not welcome! The workers were all very kind and helpful!\", 'We stayed 3 nights at Los Enquentros. We had the suite on the first floor with direct access onto the roof terrace. The ground floor rooms look a bit small and dark but are much cheaper. The decor is quirky and old fashioned but we had plenty of space and everything was clean and comfortable. The shower was hot as long as you turn it up very gently. I enjoyed sitting on the roof early in the morning and watching the birds visit with the volcanos in the background. Breakfast was nice and the owner, Irma, could not have been more helpful. The location is great, being just a few blocks from the Parque Central.', \"This place is definitely not ideal. It's very dirty, the sound proofing is extremely bad, and the lady's common areas are a hoarder's paradise. We were glad to get out of here. Only upside is that the lady is very nice and helpful. Still would not recommend it.\", \"We crashed here one night before leaving for the airport.  We go to Guatemala rather frequently and wanted to stay somewhere other than GC.  The manager lady (I don't remember her name) was fabulous.  She was up with us when we came in, and then up again when we left.  We were able to pay in American dollars, and we were able to include the cab ride to the airport the next morning.  (A tip- tell them your flight leaves 30 minutes before it actually does.  Our cab driver was at least a half hour late picking us up, and we had a nail biting drive to the airport.  Good thing the flight was delayed.)The hotel was sprawling with lots of courtyards and a rooftop terrace.  The rooms were good sized and clean.  Same with the bathroom.  The shower has that electric water heater that most\", 'I went to a wedding and a table collapsed on me full of glass vases. Could of got killed or maimed and no one from the staff apologized or did anything. They did send out a medic for the cut I had in my hand  and acted like it was my fault. I was just sitting there when it happened. Service was bad and you can hear the staff talking about you in Spanish. I would not recommend staying here.', 'I enjoyed my entire stay at this property.  It is located just a couple blocks away from everything we wanted to see.  I highly recommend room number 1.  It is 2 level room with plenty of hot water.  The front desk service was fast and courteous.  The breakfast is what you can expect from this type of hotel, and I have no complaints about it.  I will make this property my base every time I visit Antigua. If I have one complaint, it is the mattress.  Please upgrade your mattress quality, and I can rate this property higher.', \"Good hotel, great room, great location. The breakfast wasn't so good thought. the room was very private and clean. The service was good and it was a great way to start our traveling! we recommand on the upper level rooms.\", 'I went with my wife to this boutique hotel in Antigua Guatemala, and stay in the luxury suite that has a balcony. All the furniture were new and nice. The hotel has few rooms, so you felt that you are in your private mansion. Very quiet and romantic atmosphere. Walkable distance to major attractions in Antigua. Staff  helpful and friendly. ', \"We saw this hotel here and decided to visit to see if it was a place we'd like to stay another weekend. The employee who opened the door wouldn't let me in to check it out. Reservation only, he said. I said I only wanted to see the hotel and get pricing information, he said no and then opened the door so I could see the parking lot, but wouldn't let me enter. This was so insulting and outrageous.  We never will make a reservation now.\", \"It's a great hostel in Antigua if you're looking for a relaxed stay in a comfortable hostel in a great location (2 blocks from parque central). They're strict about noise after 9pm so it's not a party hostel. For partying we were able to go to other hostels just fine and come back to this hostel late at night so was perfect! Often had free coffee and water, and the wifi was good. Provided towels and had great showers and beds, as well as a kitchen available. Other guests were travellers too and met some great people. Would highly recommend!\", \"Stayed here one night, I must admit it was a random choice the night before leaving Guatemala, but totally fine. We had a private room with a clean shower, but very basic bathroom and signs everywhere reminding us of the different penalties we could experience if we left dirty towels, used both beds if we weren't 3 persons (one queen size and one single bed) - resulting in an additional charge on the bill, well, the list went on. Also, the doors weren't closed even if we locked them, they were easily pushed away and consecutively open.  They offer a 24h open reception with snacks and beverages. \", \"Nice and clean. Cheap and cheerful. Good location, close to centre, but on a quiet street. Hot showers pretty good.   The only downside is the rooms aren't very soundproof, you can hear people/cleaners on rooftop terrace moving furniture around.   \", \"This place isn't great, the staff is pretty rude and there are 100 rules unnecessary posted everywhere. The terrace closes early so you can't hang out anywhere. We wanted to switch the night we stayed to do the volcano with a friend and she said no then asked the next day if we were doing it that day (obviously it was too late). Also strick rule about only being allowed to use the bathroom in your dorm which is tiny and awkward if you have to use the washroom as a female. \", 'Overall good hotel. All staff were super cordial and attentive. We got a room with a window on a main street so sleeping on a Friday night was challenging. We requested to be moved to a different room and the experience was way better. Nice hotel', \"The hotel is beautiful, clean and well maintained, and the staff is good.  Our room was beautiful, airy and spacious, with an ingenious separation of toilet, shower and sink that worked well.  Gorgeous flowering plants are everywhere and well maintained, and the pool is sparking and warm.  There is coffee, tea and water available.  Wi-fi is a strong signal. The ONLY downside is the bar next door.  We didn't have trouble sleeping, but you need to be able to sleep through a heavy bass beat and bar noise that lasts from 7 pm until 1 am.  We accepted this as the trade-off for the excellent location.  You are a well-lit half block from the central square, so safe for going to restaurants and shops at night.\", \"Casa del Parque was just OK...the rooms had a musty smell because there is no proper ventilation in the bathroom (which was small).  The room was spacious but hot with only one fan in the room (a lot of the hotels don't have air conditioning). It's a great location but can be pretty loud because it's close to bars, but that can be a good thing if you plan to consume a lot of alcohol...you won't have far to walk.   Overall, Antigua is a great city and when I return I'll definitely stay at another hotel that's a little more upscale and offers breakfast and has a larger pool. \", 'Great location, lovely and courteous staff! We stayed in room #2 which had a nice view of the church across the street, a little drafty but nice decor. The place was over all very quiet, probably because we stayed during low season. A bit expensive considering all the accommodation options in Antigua though!', 'I have stayed at Palacio Chico several times with mission team groups. It gets us an evening where we can tour the markets, and is very close to several places to eat. They are very accomodating to let us double or triple up. The facility is clean, quiet, and the staff always helpful.   Las Torches across the street is a good restaurant, with easy walking to Palacio Chico. Pricey wine, but the food is fairly priced for the area.', 'This hotel was centrally located to great restaurants, central park. The room we had #6 was fabulous! Beautiful decor, nice touches, etc. the staff was helpful and courteous.The patio/garden was lovely w/parakeets that kept you company while you had a simple breakfast that was included w/ the room. I will most definitely go back! Rach', 'The hotel is near to the central park. It has a great service and the employees always are attentive. The price is ok according to the quality. I recommend to travel to Antigua, Guatemala and to this hotel.', 'We (couple, 40 & 50 years old) stayed at Posada Don Valentino for one night in November 2013 and paid about $40 a night.  Our room was small but clean.  The bathroom was also small but clean; the water was hot.  There was a room safe and cable television.  The hotel is quiet and has a kitchen and salon.  It is about four blocks from Parque Central and one block from the market.  We stayed in four Antigua hotels over five nights and this was the best one for the price.', \"This place is run-down, dirty in places, and it's apparent that the ownership lacks the incentive to invest in new things to update an old property.  In our first room, both the TV and shower were broken.  They brought in old sets until one barely worked.    The worst part is that we requested the wake-up call for a morning shuttle to the airport 3 times, because they seemed arrogant and confused.  They didn't wake-us up!  This is the first time this has ever happened to me.  When I told the front office person, she told me to write complaint forms and it wasn't her fault because it was in a book that she showed me.  She did seem upset, but this is a process that should work within any hotel.    On a minor note, the rooms are over-priced for what you get by Antigua standards. \", 'Great location right near la Merced church which was the centre for many of the Easter festivities over semana Santa which was just amazing. Small and intimate hotel, made friends easily with the other guests. The staff were very helpful, overall enjoyed my stay. ', \"I stayed 1 night on my way back to Guatemala City, the room was comfortable and clean and I was lucky enough to have a room with a view of the rooftops.  There are only 9 rooms or so and it looks like most of them don't have any natural light as they look onto an internal courtyard and stairwell.  The lone guy working on reception was very good, despite his lack of English he was really helpful.\", 'We just stayed in Posada San Vincente for 1 night on our way between Guatemala City and Lago Atitlan. We arrived pretty late but they were great. Got us checked in quickly. Room was basic, but clean and had everything we needed. Quiet too! In the morning we spent some time on the rooftop patio, which is gorgeous. Would be a great place to chill in the daytime. Free coffee, tea and water available, and good internet access.   They also arranged our airport pickup from Guatemala City - everything went smoothly.', 'The hotel is pretty, very centrally located,  and the roof terrace was nice for reading.  Staff seemed fine and we were able to store our bags after checking out.   Room was big - we had a single and double bed - and free reliable wifi.  However,  our shower was terrible and flooded our room. Our room was close to what I think was a staff room, and staff were very loud during the day and early in the morning. Also, there were quite a few children playing outside our room throughout our stay.   It was fine,  but we stayed in nicer and cheaper hotels in Antigua.  ', 'Close to the central square in the old town, nice garden area on the ground floor and a roof top patio area where you can relax. We were able to leave our big bags here as we moved around on excursions. Kitchen available for shared use.

But the location (close to the central parc) and the lovely courtyard makes up for it.', \"Great front staff-helpful for setting up excursions/transportation.   Front staff spoke Engliish during the day.  The door was locked at night and you had to knock to get in.  Room clean.  Clean water for drinking and filling water bottles.  Perfect location.  No AC but didn't need.  Great views on balcony.  There is a rooster close by, so can be a little noisy.\", \"Stayed here with a group of 10 for one night before heading out to the airport in Guatemala City. The price was great and the staff was friendly and helpful but it's definitely a no-frills kind of place. The shower in one of our rooms was broken, but quickly repaired, though water pressure was still pretty awful. We were on the first floor and it was very noisy at night; not sure if it was staff, fellow guests or street noise. Staff helped us arrange very affordable airport transportation and the free WiFi was pretty strong for Guatemala. It's a good, safe place for a quick stay for those on a budget, but for ~$15 more per night per person, there are much nicer options in Antigua.\", 'Room was small.  Bathroom small.  Sparce.  Reasonably clean.  Rock hard mattresses and pillows.  Some of the staff remarkably reserved, almost surly.  Others very friendly.  (These people see a lot of difficult foreigners and could easily get jaded.)  We came to Antigua from a week in a rental house at Atitlan.  The return to one small hotel room could bias my perception of it.  It was not anything special for the price we paid.  We had reserved ahead of time because I had my wife and two youngest daughters and did not want to be looking for a place with them in tow.  I am sure we could have secured a much better price if we had negotiated it upon arrival.', \"Staff is very friendly and helpful. Wifi works well.  My friends first floor room intensly smelled like moth balls. Since there is only a small window facing the interior patio, the smell cannot be eliminated. Yikes. I stayed on the 2nd Floor and the smell was not so detectable.  Any noise echoes in the interior of the hotel, so be aware. It's like that in most colonial hotels. I found it a bad value for the money $35/night. No coffee or food available. There are better alternatives in Antigua for less money, like the Juma Ocag, a lovely place.\", 'Clean, spacious rooms. Friendly staff. Just two blocks form the plaza (center of town). Although there is no noise isolation, it is rather quite at night, which means a night good sleep. Kitchenette available.', 'I stayed at a few hostels in Antigua and this is fine the main issue of noise from the courtyard. 3 people talking sounds like a party in the room! The breakfast is okay just a bit slow. The wifi could be improved as well', 'The hostel staff are great and are always willing to help with requests, booking tours and shuttles etc. I would strongly recommend that you book the Acatenango hike through the hostel as it is proved to be professionally done. There is free water and coffee 24/7 and a nice few communal areas as well as a fully functioning kitchen and bar. The rooms are large and have plenty of storage space and the beds all have an individual light and are comfortable.', \"We had a pleasant stay here because of the following: Very comfortable beds and good night's sleep. Attractive communal areas including a pretty garden. Good breakfast included that you can enjoy every morning in said garden. Generally happy and pleasant staff. Good security measures with the front entrance having a friendly young lad on the door evenings/early mornings. Erm... Guess that's it... Quite a few good things though, eh?\", 'This is a basic clean hostel with shared bathrooms. Our room was a basic room which was clean and comfortable.There was a reasonable breakfast and a nice garden to eat breakfast. The location was very good and it had  good wifi. There is good night security. Shop around for travel deals and laundry as they are slightly more expensive than other places nearby.', \"on first look Jacaranda doesnt look like much as the rooms are quite basic. but the place is really clean - there were always cleaners around- and the price is great especially when you consider that a freshly made breakfast is included. its also got very good security throughout the night which is important in Antigua. the showers take a while to heat up but if you persevere you can get hot water! its good for couples or people travelling not looking to socialise, although if you're looking for a hostel vibe i wouldn't recommend it.\", 'I was a bit late in organising accom for my arrival in Guatemala so was going in blind. However, I have no regrets.  Lucy on front desk is great with perfect English. The hostel is clean and basic and seems to attract a very chilled vibe as opposed to other more party hostels.  Breakfast is great also.', 'I stayed a couple of nights in this hostel at the beginning of my trip in Guatemala, and decided to stop there again before leaving the country. It is a quiet place and the staff was always very nice and helpful. I had a small single room (maybe the illumination can be improved) and the shared bathroom was clean and comfortable. In the morning you can choose among a few types of breakfast, which was good. There is a nice garden in the back of the hostel.', 'Lovely courtyard where you can relax have a drink and sit in the sun. Rooms fairly basic but nice enough. Hot water nice views from rooftop. Pretty decor resembling some spanish heritage. Rooms large. Only annoying thing is that you have to knock or rung the bell whenever you want to get into the hotel which means we were woken up late and early as you can hear it in your room.pick a room on a higher floor on the other side of the courtyard ', 'I stayed here recently for a few nights. The location is good, just four blocks away from the main plaza. The courtyard area and rooftop are nice and the rooms were spacious and clean. You need to leave the shower running for a good five minutes before it starts to warm up though! The breakfasts were nice and reasonably priced. Staff were also friendly but didn’t understand much English. WiFi worked quite well. Overall decent enough hotel.', 'Quiet hotel, with very nice accomodation! People is very knid and always willing to satisfy the client. Breakfast on the roof is very good, with an excellent view on the city and mountains! However, bad smell in the bathroom (but which can be easily fixed)', 'This place looks not much from the outside, but when you enter it has a beautiful centre courtyard.  All the rooms come off the centre, it can be noisy if there are people in the courtyard as the noise travels upwards.  If you have room backing onto the road, this can too be noisy with local traffic on the cobbled roads.  Breakfast is on the roof with a great view to volcanoes, which you can see them puffing smoke.  Close location to the centre of town, with good restaurants also close by.', 'This hotel is located an easy 10 minute walk from the city center which makes it a nice quiet place from traffic. The view from the roof of the hotel where you have breakfast is fantastic. You can choose from a menu which free breakfast you would like. I ordered pancakes one morning that came with 2 pancakes, 3 different fruit slices, yogurt and granola, it was fantastic!  The staff are very pleasant and helpful, most also speak excellent English especially the desk staff.  I agree with other reviewers regarding hearing everything in your room so if guests are holding conversations at 3 in the morning as they are leaving you can hear everything. You would think that the guests themselves would understand the need to be quiet when they are in the courtyard at night.', \"Stayed here to attend a friend's wedding in a chapel in town. This is a charming hotel, walking distance from everything, great breakfast, quiet and has a great rooftop view while you eat. The staff was very nice and attentive and Antigua is simply beautiful.\", 'i recently lead a group of 13 to Antigua and Panajachel. the tour company booked us into this hotel. it was very convenient - 2 blocks from Plaza Central w/ several restaurants and small cafes nearby. the interior of the hotel is like an antique store - all sorts of older chairs, telephones, furniture, typewriters here and there. rooms ranged from small [one queen bed w/ two armoires and desk] to spacious [two queen beds, etc]. wifi was available at no charge - good signal. Luis and staff were excellent - friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. no breakfasts but two small cafes nearby.  if you can deal w/ an older place but great staff, San Sebastian is a great choice.', 'The grounds are spectacular. I loved the energy of the property. Overall the staff was quite accommodating. Make sure that when you are booking a room that you specify which room type you are requesting. The food was very good. I wish there were more choices for gluten free. ', 'Tiny and old rooms (we booked a double room). Almost no light, just like a cave. However the room was clean. The bed was not good so it was difficult to rest properly. On the other side the bathroom was good comparing to the room itself.  No breakfast included and there is no restaurant in the hostal. Anyway there is a kitchen for the guests.  Location was good, few steps from the Parque Central. We booked private shuttle from the airport. They charge an additional fee of Q50 per every hour your flight is delayed. They warn about that when you book the shuttle and it is supposed to pay the additional hour of parking in the airport. Once we took the shuttle we didnt see the driver paying anything and passing any parking barrier, so I wonder if those 50Q are really a fraud. Just', \"First things first: the dorms have no supporting furniture whatsoever, just the tiny locker... there is no space for nothing, all is crammed... we are talking about twelve persons and all their personal belongings. A mess.   The bathroom is cleaned once a day, not enough, again, when we are talking about 12 persons using it... when I arrived, just before cleaning, the rubbish bin was full - not a nice thing to see or smell - and on top of that there was no toilette paper (fortunately I noticed that in advance).  Common space is limited to a sterile rooftop with three tables and two sunbeds. Kitchen is also in the rooftop. Now imagine... it's raining or windy and cold... no place to be except in the awfully crowded and messy dorm. And access to the  kitchen will be for the braves\", 'We spent a weekend in Antigua, and this hotel was very good.  I have stayed in Antigua several times before and this is the closest I have stayed to the central plaza, and is very convenient if you are traveling alone is safe to walk at any time to the plaza and then come back.  The staff was outstanding, so kind and helpful and the hotel had a nice pool and good rooms.  I liked it a lot.  The price was also very reasonable.', 'I stayed here in May with a group volunteering with Safe Passage. I was very happy with my second floor room (#7) and even though there is a loud bar next door I was able to muffle the noise with the room fan and my white noise machine. The room was cleaned promptly and well each day and staff were polite, even when - due to a reservation glitch - we needed to be moved out of the hotel a day early. Staff helped me move my luggage to a sister property down the street. Breakfast was good also.', \"If you want to spend some time like if you were at some relative's home, to feel yourself welcome and well attended in a cozy ambiance, this is the place. My family and I have spent some quality moments there, and we have nothing to regret. The owners will treat you like you would treat an old friend. You can enjoy the silence of the country if you want to rest and if you want to go to a bar or a restaurant and socialize with others, within a few minutes you can get to Antigua. Hope to get back soon.\", \"After a few nights' stay at El Hostal earlier in our trip, we were really happy we decided to try Posada Don Valentino for our 2nd stage in Antigua. There's a lot more happening at this end of town, more places to eat, it's close to the parque central (central park). Plus the posada is very quiet, offering an excellent night's stay. The staff were very friendly and polite.   The only two minor issues were with the water (somewhat difficult to regulate the shower temperature, although we had the same issue at most of the places we stayed, but for this slightly pricier place, we expected a bit better) and the two rooms we got were rather dark (however, this seems to be typical in Antigua and indeed throughout Guatemala).  Note that a pool is advertised but it's in another property\", \"I have made the Don Valentino my home in Antigua on 3 occasions, one was for a week, Other stops were for 2 days. Many positives: English speaking staff, all lovely ladies. The location is the best: Out the door, turn right, for a large grocery, just doors away. Another block to the big market.    A short walk the other way to an ATM, the Central Park, and a place we love for morning coffee, The Bagel Barn, a big gringo gathering spot because of good wifi. A block from the Park is Mono Loco, another gringo favorite because you can watch any sporting event. If it's televised anywhere they have it.   Across the street from the Don Valentino is one of my favorite restaurants, La Pena de Sol Latino. Great food, reasonable prices. The owner is an ex pat from Nashville.

All have been pleasant or at least adventurous.  In fact...I need to write reviews for all of my positive stays.  This hotel made me sad.  They hotel took my request for a room.  I confirmed.  Three days later I received an email saying they were sorry but they had given my room to a larger group.  Interesting.  I guess I expected something more then an excuse from them but in the end that is what I got.  I was never offered a real apology just', 'The friendly lady at the reception ensures that the guests are comfortable: from breakfast till organizing tours and farewell. The patio is a rustic place to relax and the rooms have a comfortable, romantic atmosphere.', 'The hotel is very inexpensive and our room was very clean.  The courtyard was very beautiful and was perfect for coffee in the morning.  The location is very good since it is close to the city center. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.   It is perfect for a quick weekend trip, but I would not recommend for extended stays.  There is nothing special about the rooms and all.', 'I totally enjoyed my stay at Posada Dona Luisa. Reasonable rates, clean nice rooms good view of the volcano...Couple blocks from the main square.The hotel is safe and has locked doors at all times.  The shower needs a facelift for sure. The staff was friendly and helpful in every way...I would recommend coming here if you want to save money and be able to walk into town to enjoy beautiful Antigua.', 'For a lot of old hippies, to get a clean shower, a decent bed, and get off the street would have been paradise.  Cramped quarters, clean, sheets and fresh coffee, INSTANT in a land known for his roasting and grinding..it´s good for those seeking adventure.  A bummer you have to pay $7.50 USD a night to park your car 3 blocks away. It is less than 4 blocks to the big center of town where the Indian venders come to see you everything, including cell phones they stole from someone the day before.', 'We had a great stay here and at 3 other hotels under the same chain (long story). At each place, we negotiated a rate of 25 a night which didnt include breakfadt but gave us access to good clean kitchens, wifi (except on hotel) and very lovely staff. These hotels are easy places to stay for a good price. Get involved!', 'Very typical Posada, great location, conveniently close to everything, very friendly staff, good service, clean basic rooms... My recommendation is to avoid Room # 1 by all means, it is literally right by the reception area (3 steps), and so can be extremely noisy! Other than that, I would recommend!', \"Their customer service is really really bad. Unfriendly and seemingly uninterested to make their customers happy. The beautiful yard is sprayed with pesticides which stinks for hours (even smelled it the next day...)  They made a mistake with our booking and skipped a day (so they wanted us to leave for one night and return the next day). We wanted our money back instead as we didn't want to move every day. but for over 1 hour they refused to do so. The owner lives in the US and apparently failed to give any staff member the power to 'change the policies re 3 day cancellation period' or the memo that making their customers happy will make them return. We will not.\", \"This place has horrendous customer service, old mattress that you can feel all of the springs in, it is super loud and the workers wake you up first thing in the morning as their chatter echoes through the whole hotel. And don't think you can book in and cancel later because you hate  it because they will still charge you the FULL price to cancel your room. There are so many wonderful places to stay in Antigua, this place isn't worth your time or money.\", 'Nice place close to central park. We just walked in and asked for a room they gave to us for 280q. For somthing equal to this normaly would be 400q. Id say average size rooms with hot water.pillows a bit hard.

', 'My stay at three monkeys was okay, but I would not stay here again. On a positive note it’s in an excellent location, very close to many restaurants and bars, the people staying and working there were great, and the onsite bar was cheap! So if you love to party it’s a good place to stay.  However the beds are uncomfortable and have bed bugs, the showers only have hot water at a pressure so low it’s like a sad trickle of a bucket, and the tours booked through the hostel were sub-par. The hostel tours consistently ran 30mins - 1 hour late and crammed so many people onto a bus it was like a chicken bus for tourists. There are heaps of tour companies around Antigua so I would recommend shopping around.', 'A cool little hostel in a good location. Aesthetically ticks the box, cute garden area, hammocks, cool lighting. Felt trendy and definitely frequented by the ‘younger’ traveller / gap years etc Basic bedrooms, reasonably comfortable, a little loud at night but couldn’t complain for the price. It did the job for a one night stop gap and the staff we did meet were really friendly. ', 'We loved the hostel! We felt very comfy since the moment we got there.

Breakfast was nice and included. Staff is helpful with shuttleservices. Located near the main avenue', 'I had a great time in Casa Jacaranda! The garden is an amazing place to just sit read a book and relax! One of the best thing about this place was the included breakfast and the kitchen they have for the guests! The bathroom were always clean and the bedroom too.   One bad thing is that they dont have outlets at the dorms but you can charge your stuff at the kitchen or somewhere else.  The staff was always willing to help with a smile and kindness! ', \"When I arrived here the hostel felt a bit weird, because of the man that showed me the place did everything very quick and didn't really explain. It was very dark everywhere and annoying western music. But then I saw the garden in the back, the clean and comfortable bathroom and my private room was nice as well, so at the end it was good. Not a really social place and a bit outside the centre, but in front of la Merced you can eat really good food at night and it's safe to walk there alone!\", \"Quiet south side of town, around the corner from deluxe hotels, just a few blocks to Parque Central. Sunny rooms along tiled walkways surround lush garden with plashing fountain (muted at night). Great deal! I stayed 16 days, each morning checking out the weather & taking in views of Vulcán de Agua and puffing Volcán de Fuego from the rooftop terrace. Complimentary coffee & drinking water. Optional breakfast was decent, served alfresco & only a little more than you'd pay in a typical cafe. Abundant in-room storage.\", 'The staff at this hotel are extremely pleasant and courteous.  They do speak enough English to communicate.   The rooftop terrace is excellent for viewing the volcano and nearby hills over the town.  The grounds are well kept with nice flowers and landscaping.   We enjoyed the walk to parqué central just 4 blocks away.  We will not stay here again due to a small number of mosquitos in the room and the head-ache-inducing odour of insecticides on about half of the property.  We were pleased however that our room was changed to a less smelly insecticide room.  Finally,  they told us they would accept Quetzals or US cash.  We tried to pay with $100 US.  Staff said they could not do so because they did not have enough change in Quetzals or USD$.  Rate was 7.5 to 1 if they had.  Later', \"This hotel would be so nice, if it weren't so noisy.

There is also a lovely roof top terrace from where you can enjoy the views of the lava on the active volcano nearby Antigua.\", \"Pros: Beautiful courtyard, nice rooftop for breakfast, and clean well decorated rooms with A/C. 5-10 minute walk from centre of town. Cons: The front door to the building is always locked so you have to press the buzzer and wait for the staff to let you in every time you enter the hotel. At least they are there to open the door 24/7. Can't comment on price because went here as part of a tour package.\", 'The hotel itself is beautiful as the courtyard is covered in beautiful plants.

From there, through an inconspicuous door, you reach a wonderful patio and the newer part of the hotel.

It looks fantastic, but it can get quite loud as the seating arrangements outside the hotel rooms encourage dwellers to sit outside, but the noise wasn't particularly jarring. It's also very centrally located: just a couple of blocks from the central square (and always a ten minute walk to wherever may be recommended in terms of food, bars, or sights). There's also a rooftop area with seating arrangements and a beautiful view of the volcano and Antigua in general.  The staff was great, in particular the women at the front desk: very pleasant to deal with and they went above and beyond their role to help with our queries and ensure we got to Guatemala\", 'We stayed here for one night after night hiking volcano Tajamulco, which meant we needed sleep. For this, this hostel was great. Not a party hostel at all which suited us perfect but not the best if you want to socialize.  Nice breakfast included and computer to use for free. Friendly staff. Bathrooms a bit dirty though.', 'I stayed at Jacaranda three seperate times throughout my Guatemala trip. It\\'s a nice, clean, quiet place to stay in Antigua. The staff are super friendly and also speak good English in case that\\'s important. The breakfasts are excellent!!

Try the canillitas de leche, they are delicious!', \"The hostel was clean and the reception was nice. However, although the breakfast was free, it was awful. Also, they advertise on hostel world and other websites that there is a restaurant and bar which is not true! Other than breakfast, you can not order any other food or snacks.. There also is not a bar at all, with the exception of ONE small fridge with a few beers in it. We found the hostel to be a little too quiet. We were travelling as a couple, but also looking to meet a lot of people. Overall, we were't a fan of Antigua in general because there wasn't too much to do, but if you're looking for a small quiet town and a small quiet hostel, then this might be a great choice for you!\", 'We spent a total of 6 nights and it was lovely.  The three reception staff members, Wendy, Carmen and Karen, could not have been more accommodating or responsive.  Rooms are cozy and clean, if a tad small.

It was nice that they provided two bottles of water.  The wifi was strong and fast.', 'We went on a very busy time in Antigua, Easter (Semana Santa) and the small town was crowded.  But we were happy with this accommodation, which included all three meals. The hotel is simple, but very clean.  They served meals (on this ocassion) in the terrace overlooking the volcano.  It was lovely.  The staff was kind, but no so helpful with respect to tours and directions.  They may need to improve that.  Location was great, a few blocks from Main Plaza.', 'This hotel was very sweet with a lovely courtyard to which all the rooms opened out to. This was a very clean hotel and the staff were very welcoming. Hot water takes a while and can cut in and out... but that is the only bad experience.

BUT the hotel has gated parking, is conveniently located and within walking distance of everything, has an amazing breakfast with a view on the roof and most importantly, a hot shower. Maybe it's because it had been a week of cold showers in other cities but I damn near cried when I got to take a hot shower and look at a volcano while I drank my coffee. \", 'We stayed two nights and had a Spa-Suite. The room was great with a privat roof terrace. The jacuzzi was dated and we didn‘t use it. There are a lot of events in the venue and people come and go.

If you don't have high expectations you will be delighted at this quaint hotel.  The 3rd story is a great view of the volcanoes.  Rooms are small but clean and mattresses pretty good.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Tip: if you stay here they do not have screens in the windows; no problem though there are not a lot of bugs.  You will have a light curtain to keep this curtain closed bring a safety pin or a barrette will do in a pinch.

Breakfast is basic but the coffee is good. Friendly service worth staying here with no expectations so you won’t be disappointed.', 'We stayed for 3 nights for $8 a night in the 12 bed dorm; the hostel was conveniently located, quiet and had very comfortable beds.

We took a private room which was 200Q a night for two nights and paid for the nights in advanced. An hour or so later we overheard the receptionist telling another guest that the hostel is fully booked. Since we were considering a third night we asked the receptionist if it also applies to the private rooms she said no, there are free private rooms.  But this is where things got weird: According to the receptionist the price of the third night will be 312Q more than a 150% increase!

I wish they served breakfast but at least they had coffee. A bit expensive but for the location I guess it is okay.

The booking was recorded as one person and not two, although the room booked was correct with twin beds.  However, they insisted on charging another $10 on arrival as the booking was incorrect on their system. Why one person would request twin beds, I don't know.

We were surprised upon checking in to see the quality of the room, considering we were paying 250 q which in this price range has been giving us modest but nice accommodation in our travels in Guatemala . As another reviewer just pointed out, the hostel does not have a proper ceiling. There is no separation between the rooms, just a tin roof covering the tops of the rooms.

As a solo traveller it's important to go somewhere where you can interact with others and I thought more people would be staying there. My room was up the back in the ample garden and as the only one staying in the back it was a little dark and spooky. (There was at least one other person staying in a dorm but I didn't see him until morning).   However (and the irony is not lost on me) late that evening (well after 12) at least two other people arrived.

The hotel is a small house, which is part of the bigger Porta Hotel, so you get access to a lot of their services like breakfast buffet, pool, spa, etc. The nice thing about the hotel is that it is very private (I think only 10 rooms), so it's definitely very quiet, so you get to relax. The rooms are clean and nicely designed. The hotel could use a little bit of work in some areas, but nothing major. It is also very conveniently located and never a far walk from all the cool spots. The only reason I don't give the hotel 5 stars is because I think the staff could have been more welcoming and friendlier.\", \"We had a good stay at the Casa Encantada, which we got to from hotel Porta Antigua (they had no rooms available and suggested their sister hotel). We were promised to have access to all of Porta Antigua facilities - including the buffet breakfast. We were very disappointed to find out that they don't serve buffet breakfast every day, even though they knew when we are going to stay and promised us to have it. The 'A la carte menu' breakfast wasn't so good...  All in all a good experience with a bitter taste.\", \"The exterior very nice, but the inside is terrible. Old furniture not taken care of, the bed sheets very old, ugly decoration and overall not very clean. The worst service ever!! The reservation said it had capacity for 6 people, but there were enough beds for 4 people only. Supposedly there was a pull out couch, but it was a normal couch, that by the way smelled like sweat. My 11 year old cousin had to sleep on pillows on the floor. The hotel staff did NOTHING to helps us find a solution or at least give us blankets. I would NEVER return there again. You can go only if you don't mind sleeping on the floor...\", \"Horrible place. Fraud. They are not providing what's in the prescription.  We were 6 people and arrived at 8pm.  We ordered 3 beds villa. Got only 2 beds. No pillows. No blanket. Dark. Bad condition. Very noisy as this is on the main road.  My kids slept on the sofa and on a mattress on the floor. No service. No one to talk with.  On the next day when I proved to them after 3 hours of argument that there are no 3 beds they said ok for refund. When i checked out and ordered in other hotel they said I will not get refund and they dont care I didnr care about not giving what they promised and that booking.com cannot do anything to chane it.  DO NOT GO THERE.  it is not a hotel. This is apartments place in bad cobdition and they are not honest. \", 'The hotel is absolutely not a luxury hotel as the name they use, and we paid more than 300 USD for one room The service is really poor, there is no restaurant, not even drinks They shoould definitely change their name and their prices', \"I stayed at Casa En Familiar as part of a Geckos/Intrepid tour. Very unhappy with this guest house. I am quite accustomed to budget travel however the room I stayed in was so dirty I refused to stay the last 2 nights and paid for another hotel. There were dead cockroaches and rubbish on the bathroom floor, also the bathroom was covered in a layer of dirt and obviously hadn't been cleaned for some time. Old is fine but there's no excuse for dirty. Antigua has many great hotels so there's no need to stay here if you can avoid it. The room also smelt like sewer.\", \"This family hotel is in need of an extreme makeover. Not much like a hotel, more like your grandparents house. The entrance area is very religious with bits of tat everywhere and a very strong oder. You will be greeted by the family dogs when you arrive from the other side of the gate.   The family house is gated off from the 'hotel' part. Upstairs the view is great, however that did not make up for the rooms. In most of the rooms three beds are crammed in amongst other furniture. No air-con but stand up fans were in the room. The bed sheets are very dated and we had a few 'mysterious' bites appear after sleeping in them.

There are rooms upstairs and down and the quality and size seems to vary.  The bed in ours was average quality at best, the bed covers were certainly due for a clean.  The bathroom was average.  The house is secure, but you needed to ring the doorbell every time no matter what time of day or night.  The area is quiet and you can walk to the main streets and to the night markets.

There was also other hotel guests on the floor above us stomping and moving furniture the entire night. We asked the desk staff several times to resolve the noise problem, but they did nothing. In the morning we asked to speak to the owner of the hotel and get some sort of refund or an upgrade for the next night, but the desk staff did nothing.

The bed linens look a bit past it and the mattresses are firm, but OK.  The showers are cold water with a little electric heater attached to the spout.

You feel as though you're a burden by asking for information.   The rooms are clean. However we had a 4 nights stay, and our bedding wasn't changed once.

There is free wifi but it doesn't work in all the rooms (not in ours too far from the router I guess). There is also a good and cheap laundry service.  The hotel is quiet at night and clean.

The hotel is an extra 5 minutes walk from the main square compared to other places but unless you're a particularly lazy person I don't think this is an issue. The setting is nice, it's a set of rooms surrounding a grass courtyard with a fountain. You share the space with the family so it's more of a B&B than a hotel. The owner speaks perfect English (she used to teach it as a foreign language) and is very helpful with planning your days. We were studying Spanish while in the city so she kindly gave us a little 5 minute lesson as she provided us breakfast.   This didn't bother us but it should be noted that this is NOT a party hotel.

So I suppose all their guests come from word of mouth and repeat customers.  I was surprised to see them here on Tripadvisor (and it is a new listing).

I was charged $75 dollars for a room that wouldn't be worth that in the USA.  The room smelled of moth balls, was gloomy, towels were threadbare, no shampoo, and lots of noise from adjoining rooms.  Halls were dark and it was hard to find the keyhole.  The night clerk was an android.  What's worse, they charge a 10% surcharge for credit cards (there was some mention of an unspecified surcharge).  I understand 4% or 5% to cover costs, but 10% is usury.

Sure, the bathroom was recently updated, but the shower had no water pressure and no hot water, just barely lukewarm.   There was a window, in the \"suite\" but only the upper part of the window would open, therefore it provided very little in the way of fresh air.  It had a transparent curtain on it.

The included breakfast was near perfect, as it was the same as I prepare for myself in Canada, yogurt, fruit, toast, strawberry jam, coffee and juice.  Rooms are clean and neat but carpeted.  I prefer tile floors rather than a wall to wall carpet, as carpets tend to wear and loose their appeal detracting from the accommodation.

The rooms are clean and basic and warm enough. It was great to enjoy a hot shower and there are televisions in the rooms.  The wifi is generally good downstairs but a bit temperamental upstairs.

My only major complaint is the shuttle company that they arranged our transportation through from Antigua to Pana.  The driver was pretty rude and he dropped us off far from the public pier and lead us into the hands of \"helpful\" boat drivers, who took us and our luggage to a private dock and attempted to have us pay 20-30 dollars for a ride to santa cruz, instead of 2.50.

The hotel was clean, quiet, comfortable and near to everything we wanted to check out. As we didn't find many reviews on Booking.com we double checked on TripAdvisor and saw that it was well reviewed and we now believe those reviews were well earned.

The host Luis, is charming...answered our emails promptly when we discovered she'd left her iPad charger there and kindly set it aside for us to pick up.

Great location to Park Centrale.\", \"Stayed 3 nights in the middle of the week (it was almost empty but on Friday they were full) with a room overlooking the fountain and courtyard. Local artwork and beauteous fauna accented the clean comfortable rooms. Be sure to check out the rooftop patio with Volcan Agua dominating the vista.

I found this place online advertised for lower rate and asked for them to meet it. They said they couldn't meet that low low price ($14) but they could give me a single room for $25. I still thought that was a bargain. I loved how clean and maintained it was. The garden with wrought iron furniture, the typical Guatemalan wooden furniture, paintings, the spacious rooftop terrace, clean kitchen, and best of all the delightful customer service. I took advantage of the $5 pool at sister hotel and that was excellent. I also took advantage of the 45Q small bag laundry service.

Great option for families, too.', \"Although San Jorge hotel is situated in a good location, close to the main square, the rooms are drab and shabby around the edges and the bathroom closer to budget standard. The staff were not particularly welcoming or friendly. However, there is a pretty garden and the location is very quiet. Wouldn't  recommend this hotel to a friend, this is a pricey option for the standard of the rooms.\", 'During a business trip in Guatemala City, I was lucky to escape to Antigua.  My client booked a room for me at Hotel \"San Jorge\" and I was very happy to stay in this calm, quiet place, not far from the main square.

I recommend this place to everyone.', 'The staff at Hotel San Jorge are very accommodating, caring and responsive.  It is very easy to talk to the owner about other arrangements (transportation, laundry--which is quite cheap, even mail).  There is free mineral water for the guests.  Breakfast may not be that special, but it is quite filling, and not bad for this type of hotel.  San Jorge is also just a few block away from the Parque Central in Antigua.    The view of one of the volcanoes from the courtyard is quite relaxing too!  ', 'This building is beautiful and has a great location.  The staff was very friendly and the morning breakfast was diverse and delicious.   I accidentally booked 3 rooms instead of two and they were able to fill the 3rd room so that I was not charged an extra amount for an empty room which was extremely appreciated!   Everything was clean, comfortable and very beautiful', \"The staff, like the staff of most of the hotels in Antigua, was first class. I don't know how this happens but the staff of hotels in Antigua, after staying in just three, so far are the best I have ever seen.  This hotel was beautiful, had a nice roof deck, and a nice breakfast, but needed a little TLC. My room was called a suite, but was just a normal sized room. It had a nice bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub that didn't work. If you get a good deal this place will work out for you.\", \"I booked this hotel on the basis of good reviews on Trip Advisor and must admit I was a little disappointed. On the whole it was fine- they were friendly on reception, it felt safe, it had internet, there was a TV in our room... but the 'rustic', 'Guatemalan' aspects of the hotel basically added up to a bathroom with an old pink suite that had seen better days and we were quite cold at night with the one blanket provided.\", 'I am a 60+ woman and was a solo traveler in Antigua last week.  I always use budget hotels and very important to me is location, location, location.  The Posada Don Valentino is a few blocks from the central plaza and the municipal market.

The staff were nice and helpful and having internet available in lobby was another plus.  I was very happy here!', 'My wife and I stayed at this place on 2 separate occasions and thought the place was great. We stayed in the junior suite, which opened up on to a terrace with a great view of the volcano and the room was very spacious. Irma is a fantastic host and the breakfast she cooks is amazing. Only negative is that the power points in the room do not work but there are lots of outlets in the common areas which compensate for that.  I would highly recommend this place.

The central courtyard gives a nice sense of openness to the place great views from room terrace...Unfortunately such openness meant noise did float up into our room, but that's my only complaint!\", \"Owner supposedly sent three cabs to the airport. This is not how to deal with a delay in a flight. A hotel owner with computer and a phone can determine when a flight is delayed for three hours. A really bad ending to a difficult flight. I had no proof of what he paid, nor did I agree to pay 3x the already expensive cab fare in advance. And of course he wanted cash. Then the second 'night', if we can call the first one a night, we had trouble sleeping because the owner was outside our window, in the lobby, with loud voices. We nicely asked him to hold it down, which didn't work. All in all, less than stellar experience, to put it nicely.\", \"Myself and two chicas stayed here on New Years eve.  It was a lovely room, big and spacious with 3 queen beds.  The room had lots of character and room for luggage etc.  The lobby area had lots of antiques and artifacts to look at.  The hotel is quite central and easy to walk to the Central Park and markets.  The owner was very friendly and helpful.  It's a shame I couldn't find the artifacts I was looking for to add to my own collection :(  You will love Antigua and be sure to shop till you drop !\", 'Listed up as ‘Top choice’ in Lonely Planet, but it’s like going back in time. Old rooms, poorly decorated, not clean,… Bathrooms are cleaned one time a day and there enough for the amount of guests they have. For breakfast you can choose from 5 menu’s. Rather simple, if you compare to Yellow House, 10 meters further in the street.  Though, friendly & helpful receptionists. After one night, we went to another hotel as it wasn’t really worth the money.', 'By Guatemalan standards it is worth 4 stars, by US standards 3.  But it is nice and clean, has a, friendly and capable staff, offers dorm rooms, singles and doubles with private baths.  A rooftop patio is a delightful spot to relax.  Nice decor too.  Two blocks from the central plaza.  Wi-fi plus a computer in the officina.  Good value for Antigua.  I would stay here again.', \"This is not a party hostel which is ideal if you're just passing through Antigua with a shuttle to somewhere else early in the morning. The staff was nice, they didn't speak English like many of the reviews here said but hey, it's latin America, learn some Spanish.\", \"I stayed here 4 nights and really loved it. There is a big garden out back which really makes it special. The breakfasts are great and included in the price of the room (coffee sucks though, but there's a kitchen if you wnat to bring your own). The staff is super helpful and friendly. I was in a single room with a shared bath. Bathrooms were good and clean. Rooms are a bit boxy, but fine. great location. free wifi. Nice big kitchen outside by the garden. It's a great value.\", \"I liked staying here. It's in a chill and relatively quiet area of Antigua, but still close to cafes, restaurants, the market (big plus!), etc. It's clean, the rooms are decent, the bathrooms and showers are decent, it has a very big common space, amazing internet, good price, accessible kitchen, big outdoor patio. I highly recommend it for seasoned travelers who don't want a party vibe.\", 'Found this place by chance and it was perfect for us.

The service is very good, you will find enough privacy and a lovely roof where the breakfast is served also bar. If you are looking the advantages of bigger hotels, you can also get a pass to visit Porta Hotel antigua, to enjoy pool, jacuzzi and massage services. The best rooms are the ones that are at \"paso de agua\" because you don\\'t have the street and car crossing noise. Also up stairs, you will find more silence and better view.', 'We stayed as a group of 4 friends in a big room, the place was clean, central and quiet.  The terrace on the roof is really nice! view on the Volcano! the courtyard is also nice, great colors.  We had a good time in there, the staff is helpful.   The only con is that the wi fi is mainly available nearby the reception and not in the rooms.', 'Decided to escape the city for a day and ended up backpacking to Antigua.  I found this place after walking a bit looking for affordable places to crash.  I can say this place is great for the money.  Not full with amenities, but if you want to rest and enjoy the city, this is a great place to stay.', 'Posada San Vincente is a nice garden oasis. It is centrally located near some great local restaurants (check out the specials at the Rainbow Cafe). Our small double room was nice enough, but smelled mildly of cleaner or detergent (at least it was clean). The showers were dependably hot and the bathroom consistently cleaned. The beds were comfortable enough for a decent sleep and it was quiet at night. The television in the room was fine. Staff were very helpful in providing further travel information and as mentioned the room was always cleaned and maintained during our stay. There is a fantastic roof-top which is highly under-utilised but make sure you get yourself some drinks and spent a sunset up there. Really lovely.', 'We recommend this hotel. We stayed for New Year 2012 -2013. It was comfortable, near the central park; service was good, very helpful and willing to assist you. Also it is very safe. Fair for the price.  CONS: - TV could be better, the rooms have old CRT TV instead of flat screen, you don’t really watch TV when in Antigua, but still… - No phone in room - Late at night 11pm up; I found Internet connection intermittent, during the day from 7am up it is great.', \"... its ok, but not great, its the small things that let it down, eg weak intermittent wifi, luke warm showers, noisy, etc. but saying that they have thought about individual bunk sockets and reading lights even though I couldn't connect to wifi in my particular dorm. It's a perfect young 'flashpackers' place, with bar parties most evenings, organised tours, and a reasonably priced laundry service. The narrow roof terrace has intetesting views, the garden hammocks are relaxing, and the kitchen is adequate. The hostel is about one and a half kilometers from the bus park where there is a great open-air market too\", 'I love staying at Hotel Casa Santo Domingo because it is so beautiful. I highly recommend staying there if you are visiting Antigua. The only draw back is the attitude of the people who work there, especially the front desk people. They act like they are God’s gift to the world and you are trash. I used to stay at Hotel Casa Santo Domingo for every trip to Antigua (I go once to twice a month) but now I stay at other hotels with nicer staff. The beauty of the hotel is amazing but after you have been there a few times, I would rather stay at a place with friendlier staff. Beware if you are planning an event - they are difficult to deal with and all hotels in Antigua, not just Casa Santo Domingo, will cancel on you with little warning (a month’s notice). This happened to me and we', 'The hotel was beautifuland provided a quiet refuge frome the bustling streets whos population doubled every day for the festivities. It was a combination of luxury accommodations and tasteful religious artifacts amidst centuries old ruins of a Dominican monastery. We had a \"conventual suite\" that was spacious and comfortable. Rm 257 iverlooks the entrance to the hotel off if the street so therefore not very private for coffee on the terrace. Check in and check out was tediously antiquated. Restaurant was ok in comparison to other comparable restaurants in town, but the service was impeccable, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The surroundings absolutely gorgeous.', 'Excellent position, less than 10 mins from the Parque Central and three mins from Santa Catalina Arch. From outside, on a quiet cobbled street, it looks fairly nondescript but once you enter it is fabulous, with lots of corridors, leafy patios and drawing rooms decorated in a beautiful mixture of traditional Mayan and Spanish colonial style. The corridors / galleries outside the first floor rooms were wide enough to hold plenty of comfortable seating, and there was even the bonus of a roof terrace overlooking the town. Our room was small (for which I have subtracted a star) and it was a squeeze to get round the bed, but it was nicely decorated, comfortable and the bathroom (also small) had a good shower.', 'The location is near a very large market, and on a busy road.  There is a lot of road noise at night.  My room was on the second floor.  The room itself had decent space.  The bathroom was very cramped, to the point of sitting down sideways to using the toilet.  That said, I saw good bones up on the higher floors and they were hauling in new mattresses while I stayed.  So much of the hotel seemed unfinished.  Outside my room was a large empty area that had potential for so much more.  I saw this also on the third floor and on the mini roof area.  If you do take the chance, ask for the third floor as the rooms up there are set back more from the road and would have a good view.  The staff did seem to be good, although I had very little communication with them.', 'I found myself in Antigua, quite unplanned. I stayed at Posada Don Valentino.

But the privet room had no hot water as been told and was not clean. But the thing that really was not cool was that the owner screwed us by selling us a cab to the airport. We had to be there around 6 in the morning to go to Tikal and we could take a bus at 4 in the morning for 8 dollers. But the owner told us we would not have enough time. it should take us 1:30 ours by car. So we took a cab for 40 dollar since we did not wanted to miss the plane.

The design of the walls and colors used are great and relaxing. Not a bad location, however the lady who owns the place, Blanca, doesn't wash the sheets after each person uses them. A couple of friends of mine and I were staying there and actually witnessed her and another girl, Nancy, cleaning the rooms. Blanca actually told Nancy not to change the sheets on one of the top bunks because the guy who had slept there had only stayed one night. Me and my other friends looked at each other in disgust.

I had a clean room, huge bed, but not much hot water. Breakfast on the rooftop terrace made up for the lack of hot water! It was magical! I have stayed in other hotels in Antigua and have had other views, but this was a new one and the sky in the evening was glorious. There seemed to be only one young man at the desk the first day who spoke English. I needed a shuttle to get me to Atitlán and they couldn't help with that, but there were two travel agencies right around the corner so that wasn't a problem either. Great location and the restaurant Saberico right there!\", 'To say this is a moderate hotel is way over-stated.  We reserved a two bed room.  Our first reaction was being hit by the smell of mold and mildew coming from the bathroom.  There was no table, chair or anything to lay our luggage on.  The beds were against walls that were crumbling with about a 2 foot gap between the two single beds.  There was visible black mold growing in the bathroom, by the sink, shower and even on the ceiling.  The only air source was from a transom window directly onto a very noisy hallway.  Our first course of action was to ask for a different room.  We were shown two:  The Kingsize bedroom right next door (same exact issues), then another further in the back of the hotel that was even smaller and had a cracked toilet with brown stains inside the bowl.

Right plonk in centre of the majority of places i preferred to visit.The rooms are new I think and very nicely decorated. Only negative is they charge a hefty fee for using credit card and all the rooms were ‘damp’ in feel/smell during the time I was there (hopefully that was momentary). Breakfast is pretty good. Wifi works well in rooms.', 'We stayed here twice while in Guatemala. The staff was very accommodating, the rooms were clean and breakfast was fine. Our room was rather warm but we had a fan.

It is in a great location in Antigua, right in the centre opposite the handicraft market and everything is within walking distance and on first sight this place looks beautiful and peaceful. However, as nice and clean as the rooms are, there is no privacy in this place as the walls are paper thin. You can hear everything from every room, you can hear noise from the lobby up on the third floor, and the staff do not seem to care about this. The lady on reception during the day was less than helpful, and when a member of our group asked her to turn down the loud coldplay music because one of us was trying to sleep we were rudely told no because she wanted to listen to it while having lunch with her friends in the middle of the courtyard.

The staff were extremely friendly & helpful.  The breakfast is a real positive, included in the price & you have a choice of five different menus.  I took the last remaining bed in the Casa & that happened to be a dorm bed. I don't usually opt for dorm stays as I prefer a bit of privacy.  That said, the beds were very comfortable, although the one draw back is that the dorm is too small for the three bunks in the room, as the remaining floor space does not allow for room to unpack, repack or organise your bag.

The other thing is that you hope you don't get a room by the bar because you will not be able to sleep before 11pm or so. It depends what you're looking for in a hostel but something about the vibe here was missing for me.

Because of the heavy foot traffic with guests coming and going it can be a bit noisy if you get a room in a busy part of the building.  Try for an upper floor room for more quiet.

He deserved a tip (propina). 2- Its location: The hotel is half block away from Domino Pizza which has 2-for-the-prize-of-one on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

Restaurant traditionnel, petit déjeuné très copieux et bon !\", \"I loved the location as it is about a block or so away from the market in Antigua.  What I hated about the hotel is the noise.  There is absolutely no sound barriers for the room.  Some annoying American family was clomping around, yelling, and making a racquet in the middle of the night and the owners didn't do anything.  It sounded like they were in my room.  Another thing that is annoying is that they have no breakfast or coffee for you.. Nada.. They do have a very good internet Cafe that serves coffee after 8:00 AM or so.  Another weird thing.. once you put your stuff in the hotel safe, you cannot get it out after 8 PM for any reason.

To their credit, they do have an 11pm curfew which seems to be fairly well enforced, but you still get loud people talking as they walk past at all hours of the night which is a shame. Slightly further out from the centre than some other places and also the wifi doesn't work well or even at all in some of the rooms.

They run fun events every night, and you really feel like a mini family while you're there. The rooftop is beautiful and the chill space/bar area is great. As far as location goes, Antigua isn't so giant that anywhere you stay is super far away, so pretty good base for walking around the city and planning day trips. The staff is awesome- they take part in socializing and are super helpful in arranging transportation.  The cleanliness is very good in the private rooms, but in the dorms could be a bit better.

My room had a magnificent view of the stairwell and all of the echoing noise that would accompany it.

The accomodations were very basic, but they were clean.  Irma and her family were very happy to help with information about tours and give other information about Antigua.  One of the highlights of my trip was experiencing the Feast of Corpus Cristi at the Merced Church, and I would never have known about this spectacle if it weren't for Irma suggesting that I go!\", \"I stayed in Los Encuentros twice - my first 2 nights in Guatemala and my last one. The first time I had a private room with a little window, the second time I opted for the windowless dorm room as it's a little cheaper (I was the only person in that room anyway).  Though I have stayed for less in similar accommodation in other towns (Panajachel, San Marcos) I think that Antigua might be slightly more expensive in general.  The location is good, the rooms and shared bathrooms clean and best of all, Irma and her son (the husband wasn't usually there) are super friendly and helpful. My Spanish is very limited so it was good to have the son there who's English is great.

The hotel has a great location just north of the central plaza, was spick and span, and the hot water usually worked (more than can be said for many places in Guatemala).

However, this hotel was not only more expensive than another hotel we stayed at in Antigua a few days earlier (literally twice the cost), but they required a two night minimum and the room was of far poorer quality than the first hotel.    Here are a few details of our stay: -Our quad 'deluxe' room (a higher price than the regular quad which we selected because of availability) did not have any outside-facing windows and was poorly lit. -The glass on the windows that faced the hallway were broken, allowing for anyone to reach in and open the window\", \"After staying at so many nice hotels in Guatemala, we had a reservation at Posada Don Valentino. The room was dirty with a g-string and other junk under the bed. The room only had a window to the hallway which was facing directly to the internet cafe and was therefore very noisy. Forget about sleeping late! The rate was quite a bit more than several other hotels which offer nicer rooms. I can't recommend this hotel!\", \"I've stayed at casa de maria several times and ive never been disappointed with the welcoming attitude of the owner, Maria!  She goes out of her way to makes her guests feel valued and special. The home has a beautiful patio. The rooms,  while basic, are spotless. The breakfasts and dinners are typical Guatemalan cooking. The prices very reasonable. Located about 2 blocks from huge Mercado and about 7 blocks from central park,  the location is very convenient. I return year after year because I tried several other hostels and this one surpasses the others in all the qualities that matter to a budget traveler\", \"About a ten or fifteen minute walk from the central park, so if the shuttle bus driver offers to take you right to your door for $3 more, it's not really necessary. It's a bit hard to find, but it's right across the street from a red building with a cobbler shop called Landis. Just ring the bell and someone will let you in. My room had two beds, a dresser and a window out on to the internal courtyard. Maria was very pleasant and patient with my poor Spanish. The meals, which were $5 extra, were very good. Breakfast was more than enough to allow me to skip lunch. All in all, and excellent place to stay if you're on a tight budget.\", 'Super nice lady running the hotel. Very clean and quaint. No frills, no breakfast but good value. I used the terrace above to wash some clothes and hang up to dry. It worked out perfectly . It was a nice resting place after our hike up the volcano', \"A very good location, but quite basic and the room I was in was very dark with little natural day light. A bit odd that you can't come and go as you want - every time you want to get in you have to ring the bell and be let in by the owner - it feels more like you are a guest in his house. No breakfast facilities, but plenty of places nearby. It is very cold in the rooms - so make sure you ask for an extra blanket!\", 'This a very basic hotel but has everything you need in a great location, clean, people is nice and very affordable, I would gladly go back and stay there. Rosa and family are very nice people always trying to help.', 'As Antigua is an overpriced twon in general, it is hard to find an accomodation with private bathroom for <30 Usd. We booked the hostel in advance, as we arrived in Guatemala City in the evening. Anyway I would not recommend to spend your nights there. The walls do not have the best sound proof, the room is quite small and the bed was hard like concrete. As we couls note close one of are windows, because the glass was missing - a rooftop party a couple of blocks kept us awake until 2am, which is pretty anoying after a long day. Anyway, the loaction, one block aqy from the parque central, is perfect. ', \"As prices in Antigua are pretty high we were glad to find something affordable. The place is not far away from the Central Park and things to eat, which is really nice but the it's disadvantage too. There is a club/disco not far away with a big rooftop terrace and really loud music. We were there during the weekend and there was so loud music all day long until the night. Even oropax didn't worked so you can imagine how loud it was.  The hotel itself was clean but everything was really old. So it wasn't worth the 25$ for a double with private bathroom.\", 'Pleasant terrace for breakfast, and downstairs sitting area. Tea and coffee available through day. Safe in room. Furniture is very dark and heavy and the room is very poorly lit, so overall impression is quite gloomy. Quite expensive for the facilities.', 'The hotel is beautiful.  But be very careful before you make reservations as the hotel does not accept any cancellations.  I mistakenly made two separate reservations and when discovered the hotel refused to cancel either room.', 'I booked this hotel because of how many people told me it was such a great and beautiful place. Well, I don’t think it such a great place after my stay here. The room was more of a 3 star hotel, it was spacious, but noisy since it was close to a maintenance space of the hotel and during the night we could hear banging and some other noises, we called the lobby and they did manage to help. The bathroom was completely outdated and the tiles were moldy on some parts. Not what you expect out of a 5 star hotel. I’ve stayed at other 5 star hotels in Antigua Guatemala and had better experiences there so far. Worst part was the awful service provided in the restaurant during breakfast, they said guests didn’t have to wait but we did. The spa was the best part of the hotel, I highly', 'After being robbed on our last day of all our cash, we asked the front desk service of this 5star hotel to help us with 50 (quetzales - us$7 we needed that in cash for returning our rental car the next day (parking)) and to charge us the amount to our room which we would pay by check out the next day. They refused helping us. After arming a scene they got the manager who finally agreed to help. The next day when we checked out they charged us a commission of 16%. In all my travels worldwide I have never felt treated that badly..... Although location of this hotel is unique. The mentality/service we faced after being robbed was absolutely horrible. Last but not least they serve you water in plastic bottles, taking into account their country has serious garbage recycling issues', \"I stayed at Luna Maya for 3 nights over Christmas. Definitely more expensive than most hostels in Antigua but nice.  Not the place if you want a social scene.  Dorm beds were really comfortable and if you have a bottom bunk it’s like have a pod with a curtain, light and even a shelf. Top bunks have steps not scary ladders. Easy to get a good night's sleep.  Nice bathroom and no one else ever seemed around, so not busy even though just one per dorm room. Limited social space or maybe just no one knows to use it or doesn't feel like they can use it. I pretty much never saw other guests, everyone in my room seemed to be in bed by 8 and off by 6.  Front desk staffed 8 to 8, so it seems desolate at night, like wandered around an abandoned mansion. They understand English but don’t\", 'I stayed at Luna Maya for several nights and loved the place. It was very peaceful and clean and a great little oasis to relax in after a long day.   The beds were super comfortable and there was plenty of space in the dorms. The pictures on their website are quite accurate in this respect.   There was a yoga studio in the building but I didn’t see any schedule for taking part which might have been good to get guests involved. They did let me use the room for my own practice which was nice. I also noticed there was a room set up for massage but again no details on prices or booking. A few people passing through were looking for massages so they really missed a trick here.   My only complaint with this place was their enthusiasm for cleaning the dorms in the mornings. On the day', 'Hi  We stayed there to experience the lovely ruins of Antigua which were declared by the UN as a world heritage city.

This hotel has nothing to do with the lovely ambiance of the city.', \"Great boutique hotel right outside of Antigua.  The rooms were superbly done using an eye for detail and sense of style.  I can't remember the name of our suite, but it had a french door that opened right onto the small lap pool and a working fireplace, really quiet charming.   The staff was unobtrusive and always there when you needed them, if not, they gave you privacy and made you feel like you had run of this gorgeous villa.   Breakfast on the rooftop in the morning is unforgettable.  This hotel isn't in Antiqua proper, rather a very short walk from the main square....it's built in a new secure planned complex, where in time (we're told) there will be restaurants and other amenities, but as for now, it's kind of quiet and feels a little empty.   Regardless, this charming\", 'Lovely little hostel where breakfast is included in the price of the dorms. More affordable for you penny pinchers, dorms in high season were 9 usd per night, but were relatively cramped with little space to place your bags if the dorms are full.

Pros: -free breakfast -cheap -clean bathrooms and dorms -taco shop located inside the hostel for 3 tacos for 10Q  Cons: -overcharge for laundry services  -on the outskirts of the city, about a 15 minute walk to central plaza  -no outside liquor allowed in the hostel and they only serve beer ', 'I stayed here 3 different times for a total of 16 nights.

We paid a 10% deposit and were told our booking was confirmed. We showed up with the print-out of our confirmation (as we were told to do) and the guy at the front desk was incredibly unhelpful and pretty rude. He told us they had NO record of our booking (which basically means they lost it) and then told us 1) the problem was with hostel world and that we would need to contact them; and 2) that this had happened to someone else earlier that day! This was pretty infuriating since I have used hostel world before and not ended up in this situation, so I know that Jacaranda must have lost our reservation (though I am in the process of complaining', \"The rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The hostel was conveniently located about 10 minutes from the main square, and breakfast was included in the very reasonable price of the room.

There was free Wi-Fi, however it was only available in the main entrance and living room. Despite this small inconvenience, the internet speed was great and there was no shortage of plugs for laptops. There was also a computer available to guests who did not bring their own.

Breakfast was supposed to be served between 7am-10am. I had a shuttle coming at 8 am, and was still waiting for food, which when finally did arrive, was a very small portion and had stale bread. Disappointing value for money in my opinion.', \"My wife and I enjoyed our stay during Semana Santa.  The rooms cost a little more than we expected, but this was probably due to the holidays.  Staff very helpful and friendly.  Older but very clean.  This hotel has a very nice area downstairs with tables in a shaded, plant filled, courtyard.  It also has a small kitchen for guests to use which contains a pila, refrigerator, stove, microwave, toaster oven and kitchen utensils/plates/silverware, etc.  This is useful if you don't want to eat out all the time.  Beds tend to be firm, which is what we like.  Rooms have two or three beds.  A basic budget hotel which grows on you.  We would definitely stay there again.

Lot of noise during the night from the bar next door, so be aware, especially in the weekend. The staff did their best and were friendly, but limited info was available.

The staff were super friendly and helpful, the rooms spacious and comfortable and it's just a short walk to everything but away from all the noise of the center.

When we arrived we asked the desk for two keys but were told we could only have one because they had a 24-hour receptionist to let us in the hotel and our rooms if necessary. The first night our kids were out late and when my wife and I arrived we could not get into the hotel and spent two hours waiting on the street till our kids came back and let us in. The sink and toilet were clogged and there was no one available to fix it.  The rooms have no privacy at all as all the windows face the courtyard and because of the hot weather it was very stuffy in our rooms with the windows closed.

Nice sized room, huge king sized bed, adequate bathroom with no water temperature or pressure issues. The grounds are gorgeous and well kept. Daily breakfast is fine if you mix it up a bit between the Desayuno Americano and the Chapina. There are three great bars on the street (Cafe No Se, La Biblioteca, and Cafe Sky) and some excellent eateries (Angie Angie, Y Tu Pina Tambien) and if you are a night owl you can party close to home.

We got no compensation even though we decided to stay in spite of the pool been repaired.

WIFI was spotty and a little frustrating.', 'Located close to shopping, restaurants and close walk to many tourist attractions.  The room was clean and comfortable with amenities like bottled water, coffee maker, and TV.  Wi-Fi was also included, however, the signal was weak and service was slow.

The street noise and other guests can be easily heard in your room so not recommended for light sleepers.  The staff are very professional and helpful.  What I like most about this hotel is the historic setting and location.  What I least like was the restriction of one hour only for breakfast and that outside nose in the room.', \"We stayed one night here after referral from a more expensive hotel. After traveling in budget hotels, we wanted something nicer. This beautiful little hotel fit the bill. There are 2 nice outdoor courtyards and several nice living spaces to relax in. It's in a very good location, about 2 blocks from the central park, and close to many restaurants. The rooms are clean and well designed, but simple. It was quiet at night.

Highly recommended for a mid-range hotel and we liked it more than Posada San Sebastian, at the same price. \", 'Casa de los sueños has character; that of a traditional Antigua house.

After 9 nights at an amazing hotel (see my other reviews, I'm not sure if I can mention the name here.) Unfortunately their favourite hotel was fully booked their last two days here. Therefore we checked out hotels at booking.com. We were looking at affordable hotels with a swimming pool. Casa del Parque seemed very nice and had YES a swimming pool. A little more expensive than they thought it would be but hey, you want some luxury during your holiday.  After a few hours in a car from Panajachel to Antigua, my family was ready to dive in... Apparently the swimming pool was under construction. The lady at the frontdesk told us it was mentioned at booking.com...

It had Hot Dogs and very lame pancakes. Hot Dogs? Come on!  The view of Volcan de Agua is still spectacular from the breakfast area and select rooms on the upper level.

Of course this my fault I could have challenged at the time but had booked late and central Antigua gets full at the weekends, nevertheless this suggests to me owners are more interested in your cash than you as customers.

There is a center courtyard with lush greenery and flowers and a friendly parrot named Lorenzo.  The hotel was almost empty when we were there, we were quoted $60 per night for the room but offered $50 in cash. Our room was upstairs set apart from the others - a lovely room with a roof top patio. Only problem: the shower - the cold water faucet did not work, after we alerted the manager he fixed it immediately, however the water pressure left much to be desired in the shower.

After confirming our reservation directly with them (and confirming that we were in the $285US per night master suite) we arrived at the hotel only to find that they had given our room away to another couple.  This was after the transportation that we had paid them for never arrived at the airport to take us to the hotel.  After having us wait two hours in the 40F lobby, we were taken to our promised room and brought the worst two bowls of soup and sandwiches.  We were instructed to leave our dishes on the desk and that they would get them in the morning.

Cons: infested with mosquitoes!! Could barely fall asleep. The beds were not very comfortable - I could feel most of the springs. It took me a long time to get breakfast, but I don't think that is normally the case.  I would recommend some of the other places on 1st ave - they are cheaper, don't include breakfast, but breakfast is cheap so it's worth it to stay there.\", \"Posada Ruiz #2 was our second hostel in Antigua.  It is quite basic with two outdoor sinks and no soap or towels available.  The showerheads are wired with heaters but they were inoperable at the time of our visit, so we showered cold.  We stayed three nights and were woken by loud music and crying babies several times.  The mattresses were beat-up but of higher quality than those at Kafka or Jungle Party.  Double rooms have electrical outlets but singles are plugless.  Despite its problems, Posada Ruiz provided good value at the very bottom of the lodging market.  For 40Q/night for a single, I'd stay there again.\", 'We stumbled into this place but it was quite the find! Our room was one of 3 in the back, in the garden and reasonably quiet, meaning, yes, you did get a bit of noise from what is probably a parking lot next door or that big group of young women in the garden in the morning, but not bad for Antigua. Communal showers work fine -- if you understand how the FLOW controls the temperature -- and the whole bathroom area is kept nice and clean. Plus you get an awesome breakfast -- when we were there, there were 3 types to choose from! -- all with great Guatemalan coffee. No wonder it gets booked out a lot. While the garden rooms are probably the best, beware of mosquitoes!', \"I stayed in the room 8 next to the garden. The room where nice and cool although it didn't have netting in front of the window. It was lovely to be in the garden and overall it was a very pleasant experience. Clean and lovely.  Very good service.

The location is great, just a block and a half from the central park.  It was quiet at night and we felt very safe.', 'We chose Posada Doña Luisa from looking over Trip Advisor reviews.  This was a good choice for us.  Our vacation started by arriving late on the 23rd before Christmas.  We had a beautiful room overlooking the courtyard on the ground floor.  The staff kept the hotel spotless, and were always very welcoming towards us.  The location was in the heart of everything, and yet pleasantly quiet...until midnight on Christmas Eve.  At the stroke of midnight the town erupted in fireworks.  We enjoyed the show from the second floor balcony where we could hear plenty, and enjoy fireworks over the ruins next door.  This was the perfect mid priced hotel for us.', \"I stayed on site at Casa de los Suenos as this was the location for the wedding I was attending.  It is a beautiful location to hold a wedding.  The courtyard was great for the time prior to the wedding to gather for mingling.  They did a great job putting together the room for the ceremony.  In the back they had a great dance floor surrounded by beautiful tables for the wedding party.  I can highly recommend the location for a wedding.  However, I can not recommend staying at the hotel.  I believe my girlfriend said it best when we walked into our room:  It felt like we were a friend's dark basement.

We treated ourselves to the suite (room #8) the same room our friends from NYC had  - and it is enormous, beautifully decorated but I was surprised not t find a large flat screen TV. However, in Antigua, even in the rainy season - there are better things to do than watch TV! The regular rooms of this boutique hotel are also tastefully decorated and large enough for a couple; and some rooms have 2 beds for young families.

Our very high ceilinged large room was off the cloister, looking out on to a very picturesque scene of ornate garden furniture and a delightful, well tended garden.  The dining hall and lounge area were also very grand and in keeping with the furniture that a rich merchant might have had.  We had a good breakfast each morning and the staff were helpful and polite, and not at all intrusive.  One negative was that the pool area,  although adequate, had no sun shades and had only one set of chairs - but really a small detail which I am sure could be easily remedied.       The situation, whilst being very central, was also very quiet, with the added bonus of lots of good restaurants in the next street.    One', \"Ok, first the good news!

It is a great little hotel for the price, only half a block from Central Park and close to the Arch.  There are more luxurious hotels around but they are a lot pricier.

Service is excellent and the courtyard is beautiful with lots of plants and flowers.  There is a nice little swimming pool to relax by or cool off in, as well.  Because of bars and nightclubs in the area, it can be a bit noisy in the evening on weekends.  All the central hotels have the same problem though, so I use earplugs and it's not an issue for me.\", 'This hotel is priced mid range, $75- $100.

The shower had great water pressure, they supplied bottled water every day, and toilitries were included.The only negative - wear earplugs. Hotel is in a wonderful central location, easy to get anywhere, BUT noise comes with that. I would happily stay here again. There is a GREAT deli across the street, Metiz, which I have written another review on.

Great breakfasts, freshly made, decent rooms, a lovely view of the volcano, and the small but adequate swimming pool is a great bonus for cooling down after a hot day.   Our room, number 7, is one of three recommended rooms on the first floor - number 8 (probably the best with two sides of windows, one facing the volcano directly) and number 6 being the others. We know because an Australian family that used Antigua as a base whilst they flitted around the country had sampled almost every room the hotel had to offer. Others here have made comments  about some rooms being to close to the bar/disco. It can be loud, so take note.', \"We booked this place through Booking for one night. We stayed longer in Antigua but left this place after one night. We arrived after a bumpy ride from San Pedro Atitlan and didn't feel very welcome. The women wasn't really friendly and she appointed us the most shabby bathroom. As they are all shared and prices equal, I don't really see why we should use one or another. When asking for information it was quite clear that she wasn't really good informed (which I can even understand) but what bothered me more is that she seemed annoyed with us asking for information.

I waited around for a bit and someone finally showed up and told me that they were full.

I had a group of 6 traveling on business and we ended up having the whole place to ourselves during the third week of July. If you have a choice, the top floor rooms, particularly those facing the volcano have the loveliest view. Both floors have a central meeting area that offers a full kitchen, couches and large size table to meet and prepare meals, host a meeting, etc. However with such great restaurants in Antigua, I'd recommend hitting the streets and walking towards the park nestled in the center of town.

We really appreciated our private bathroom and HOT Shower. The bathroom was clean and functional.  Breakfast is too little- they need to visit other hostels like the Yellow house and experience the daily breakfast.  This place needs a bit of love.

The rooms opened to a hallway and were, thus,not directly exposed to the sunlight. They were not air conditioned, but this did not appear necessary.  A fan was provided in each room and, for me, provided adequate cooling.

When we go to checkout, which was at 5am because we were catching a microbus to Panajachel. There was no one at the desk. We made lots of noise and knocked on the desk a couple of times because in reality there should always be someone present at the desk considering the hotel locks the doors at night and the only way youre getting in is if a worker lets you in.

We were primarily looking for a luxury suite with a jacuzzi and a swimming pool.  The room was all we expected, large and nicely furnished.  The king sized bed was first class and had nice linens. The jacuzzi was broken, and I suspect had been broken for some time; and it is my guess they have no intention of repairing it.  Perhaps a future guest can update us. The swimming pool was not properly maintained; half empty and needed new paint on the bottom. It cost an additional $5 to buy fire for the fire place.

Transfers arranged from Three Monkeys as well as said Acatenango hike were cheaper than El Hostal too, but cheapest is still talking to the different agencies around.

The rooms are cheap and come with a decent, filling breakfast (you can get a 10Q discount if you're skipping the breakfast). The beds and linens are comfortable, and the private bathrooms are clean with fairly hot showers. The rooms were clean and completely acceptable. The staff were friendly and eager to help.

Also free coffee tea and filtered water.   If you are looking for a five star resort or a super social atmosphere this really isnt the place. Look else where there are plenty of other more expensive options for you.  Also if you hate kids do yourself and the owner a favour and don't stay here either.

Its not easy to find a place in the city center with a pool and it seems like a lot of the other pool options are in large chain hotels. This is good find!

We had a beautiful room on the top floor facing the volcano and plenty of room for four girls to dump all our excess stuff and not feel cramped. We arrived in the morning and our room was ready so they allowed us to check in early (5 hours early to be exact) which we were incredibly grateful for as none of us had slept the night before and we were wiped out. The staff spoke English very well, gave us advice on day trips, and our rooms were always immaculately cleaned. The pool was beautiful and refreshing after a day of hiking.

Seemed like a great location, charming setting. Problem is the noise.  This hotel is right beside an extremely loud all night bar/rave. Sirens, cowbells, breaking glass, thumping music, the whole shebang ... all on the other side of a very thin wall. Spent a miserable night with no sleep.  Book somewhere else. Unless you're in the party crowd and need a place to finally crash at 5am. In that case this hotel would be perfect for you.  \", \"The upside, it's very clean, pretty, good staff, good rooms, nice courtyard, good location.  The downside is the big noisy bar next door that rocks out loudly at night. Also there is a lot of reverberation and echo as people walk and talk by your room. My advise is if you can get a room far from the bar side it's a good choice.  The upstairs rooms I hear all had lots of noise.  I was in 4 and heard it but not blaring.   Or if you are the one at the bar late, then enjoy and get any room! The walk home is super short! \", 'We stayed two nights at the Casa del Parque and had a nice stay.  The first night was in room 1 which was spacious but facing the street and next to the reception so it was slightly noisy - not a big problem.  The second night was in room 8 which is upstairs and overlooking the pool at the back of the building.   This room was excellent and highly recommended.  Room 6, 7 and 8, and partly 9 are all on the second floor and are the best rooms in my opinion.  Excellent location close to the Parque central.', 'The hostel itself is small, especially the commun area but clean. The location is rather good.  As noted by other reviewers most of the staff is composed of gringo \"teenagers\" (about 4-6 people of 18-25 yo) volunteers and employees living there. Some of them didn\\'t speak any Spanish. There were not especially unfriendly but it felt like guests were disturbing their first life experience abroad. One night, they decided to party (reasonably I have to admit) in the hostel. The music was quite loud and some of the staff were shouting.   This place might fit some people but there are better options in Antigua.', 'It is the first accommodation I stayed at in Antigua Guatemala, and found it to be a neat and cosy place with wonderful hosts and house pets. The location is not too bad, and it is not far from Cerro de la Cruz. It can be a tad hard to locate on the first day if the sun goes down, but Evelyn and Fernando are there to assist always.', 'Though lacked a character, the small room was comfortable and clean enough. The shower was really hot and strong, which I liked it most. Wifi was availalbe in the room and very fast. The staff were friendly and kind though they could not speak English. A good choice for budget travelers. The price was 150Q for Friday and Saturday regardless of double or single, while 110Q(1 pax) and 140(2 pax) on Sunday thru Thursday.', \"Stayed here for four nights begin february. Our room was really small (room 2), we had to step over backpacks in order to get to the bathroom because there wasn't any other place to put them, didn't bother us very muvh though. And the rooms are were quite cheap. A double including private bathroom (hot water) was 150Q a night. Staff is friendly and there is a tiny kitchen next to the reception. Not equipped to cook a fancy meal, but you can prepare a simple breakfast-egg if you want to.  \", \"Good deal in Antigua, no doubt about it, especially since breakfast is included (more on this below) but don't expect any luxury. Rooms were very average, not the cleanest we've come across, and there was almost no lighting, but decent sized. Service level depends very much on who's at the reception - we got a very good reception when we first arrived, but had a less fortunate experience the following morning. The information sheet in our room said breakfast from 8:00 - 10:00, but when we asked for our breakfast at 09:45, we were told that we were too late, as breakfast was from 7:30 to 9:30. We went back to check, and then asked the woman in the reception to come and see for herself. When she was able to confirm that we were indeed correct, she just changed the times on our\", 'This hosel is very well located in the city and it is especially convenient if you plan to do trips to volcano since the agency which organises tours is based in the hostel. This makes it very easy to communicate and organise your trip together with the guide. The hostel itself is a decent average - good value for the money, clean, quite, has good breakfast included in the price, there is a table tennis you can use to pass the time and staff is very friendly though somehow all were new when we were there and did not know much to recommend around the city. The improvement potential is there - could have more sanitary rooms, private rooms do not have windows and it gets stuffy in the night and the kitchen is not available to the guests. Definitely the highlight was the overnight', \"A small classy hotel within easy walking of the centre of town.  Breakfast on the roof is heaven but dinner is best taken at the big sister hotel in the next block. They'll make you early mornig rea without a qualm or cost.\", 'Arrived late afternoon, and checked out at 5am, and was perfect for passing through Antigua. The night guard was really friendly and helpful, recommended places to eat and let us back in when we left one of our phones after check out.  They also had the cheapest shuttles on offer, so would highly recommend booking shuttles here, to avoid be ripped off elsewhere.  However, social places weren’t amazing, and rooms pretty basic.   Would recommend if you’re looking for a quieter, non party hostel. ', 'The price for me was comparable to other hostels. I was sent here by Three Monkeys up the street, which was fully booked.  It has no atmosphere, and a just a bit run-down.  Maybe the proprietors can spend a little bit to give a little character.  Overall, it was ok for one night, and served its purpose.', 'We stayed here for just one night before moving to a nearby hostel. The reception was good and our room was small but comfortable. The hotel was a bit hard to find at first but is located not far from the plaza. ', 'The last stop on my Guatemalan adventure was the best of all of my homes away from home. Hotel Posada Dona Luisa was amazing, right in the middle of everything, yet far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the people.   The hotel has two floors with a courtyard in the centre, and a great view of a volcano. In the lobby there was access to the internet for a small fee. A staff member of the hotel was in the lobby around the clock. Also the doors to enter were locked at night.  My room was large and spacious with a great bathroom. The shower had hot water as soon as it was turned on. There was enough room to move around rather then attempt to function in one spot. There were two double beds and a small dresser.   This is defiantly a hotel I would stay at again.', 'My husband and I spent 2  nights here and I have to say it was a good experience, the room was clean and room service was on point, friendly staff. The only downs of it would be the beds are not as comfortable as we imagined or were expecting and the urban buses do start going by early in the morning, but over all it was a safe, secure hotel, and would definitely go back to it!', 'Was referred to this hotel by a friend. Stayed in the sister hotel the first night and found it to be pretty noisy. My wife and I switched to this one (same name) located on 7th ave and found a world of difference. Quiet, beautiful, & peaceful!', 'The night guard groped and attempted to rape me when I was sleeping alone on the couch. I pushed him away and he left so luckily it didn\\'t escalate. I had friends staying here, and after a night out, returned with them. The owner, Mario, used this to say, \"We\\'re trying to be understanding, we really are, but what were you doing there?\" He tried to blame me! He also told me they had the guard on paid leave, which the police later told me doesn\\'t exist in Guatemala and that Mario had lied. There are TONS of other hostels in Antigua -- CHOOSE A DIFFERENT ONE.', 'Matiox is an average hostel. You have your space, cool front desk agents especially Mely, good tours, hot shower, free coffee, etc... Only downside is the location, you need to walk 500-700m to go in the center.  ', 'WOW! What a friendly place. Super clean rooms. Views of a smoking volcano, a short walk to the action in Antigua. Really well equipped kitchen too! The staff are so nice! Movie night was really cool. Highly recommended! ', 'Casa Luna is not a hotel per se.  You\\'re really in an extended part of the family\\'s home, which may be a pro or a con depending on what you\\'re looking for.  Mario, the owner, has just had his elderly mother, his daughter, and his adorable toddler granddaughter move in with him.  Grandma is an excellent cook, and on Sunday she made a gazillion chiles rellenos.  We ate them while playing peekaboo with the little girl.  The rooms are not fancy and they are a bit rustic, but he has installed screens over the glass slats of the windows, which we appreciated, and the mattresses are new.  The showers are \"suicide showers\" and don\\'t get super hot, but we didn\\'t care.  You can\\'t beat the location--practically next door to La Merced (no getting lost!) and then from the front of the church', 'Luckily, they gave me my money back- but honestly that’s terrifying because it means they weren’t surprised that I woke up with bites on my face and arm. Very much regret staying here. The guy at the desk was very nice. And so were the other employees but the large group occupying our bunk room were obnoxious and one spent the evening making obscene noises with himself behind his curtain.', \"Go to this hostel if you want to meet people and have a party. Don't go here if you want a relaxed and quiet environment. Staff is great, just like the food the kitchen serves. Only downside is that it can be very noisy in the rooms if you want to sleep before 10.30 pm.\", 'Nothing special here other then Antonio who helped us book tours and offered direction. Staff is friendly but rooms are eh. Bathrooms are grimmy. Food in the morning was good though.  We tried to stay at el hostal but was booked! We went through hostel world ', \"Owner, his dog, the free breakfast, the room and the bar upstairs (and the view) all great. Not a party hostel but close enough to the one's that are. Very cheap laundry place on the left as you leave the hostel and the place that sells illegal mescal is on the right. I wouldn't agree with previous posters that the hostel is dirty - its traditional. Would ask reception for an anti-mozzie coil to burn in the rooms at night.\", \"We stayed in this hotel in a doble with private bathroom for 150q. It is a good room, with a window, clean and breakfast was included. WiFi doesn't reach the top rooms,but there is a computer with internet in the reception.you can use the kitchen too.  The people working there are very nice too. The rooms downstairs are a bit dark. Good place to stay in general\", \"We arrived very early in the morning with no hostel reservation and the staff were very friendly and helpful. After originally quoting way over the odds we eventually paid less than rack rate for a double with private ensuite.  It's a basic hostel with a travel agency in the reception area and a computer for guest use.  Our room was basic but relatively clean. The bathroom did have a bit of a musk to it though and the toilet took ages to refill. The shower got hot eventually, which was a pleasant surprise.  Breakfast was included and cooked and was reasonable.  Location is pretty good and walking distance to the market and bus terminal.   Recommend for a one night stay and/or if you arrive into Antigua late at night looking for somewhere to crash.\", \"We stayed across the street at Mochilero's, and then moved into this hostel for a few nights. Simple room, no AC, bathrooms were clean but not much to it. Cheap and good location, so function for a short stay.\", \"Not really impressed with the place.. Some of the staff are nice, others aren't whatsoever. Not much to it really, room is average and bathroom too. There were no other travellers around while we were there so we cant really say about the vibe. It was cheaper that other hostels around but no breaky.\", 'We had a great stay and were very happy with the staff and hotel. We choose this hotel based on location + price. We wanted to be closed the Central Park and feel safe walking to and from restaurants at night -- breakfast and coffee were very basic, but what we expected for the price and reviews. Staff was super nice and did a great job arranging our volcano trip and transportation for us. Also, we could here the music from club next door two nights we were there, but had taken ear plugs based on reviews, and it was not an issue for us.', 'is very good location, clean and spacious rooms ,the staff is helpful, street noise is high,because we stay in the nice room but is in the corner ,and another we hear the tv all nigth from another room, breakfast is poor. swimming pool is great and the sauna, coffee and te is free all day and nigth', \"I booked in this hotel because it's very well located and the photographs show a nice little hotel. Unfortunately their customer service is terrible, they charge you so many extra things, they rooms are not what they show, the hotel it's very noisy, the beds and linen are old and dirty. They change the rate after I did my down payment, they charge me extra 10% for using credit card and the over all attention was very poor. It's good that it has a swimming pool, it's very well located and some of the staff try to be helpful, but be careful, they will try to get any extra dollar from your pocket.\", 'We stayed here twice on our trip to Guatemala.  The rooms were big and clean, breakfast was good and all the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.  My only negative comment on the stay is the walls seemed to be every thin so we could hear the people in the rooms next to us (TV, talking etc), my advice would be to take earplugs.  The ladies on reception were great, extremely helpful in booking trips, travel and our onward accommodation.  If I ever went back to Guatemala, I would happily stay there again.', 'Received a warm welcome by Don Julio, the night security, who greeted me at 6:30am when I arrived tired from my overnight bus from Flores. He was so kind and offered coffee and a place to sleep in the lounge until the daytime staff arrived.   Pros: spacious rooms with lockers and ensuite room has decent bathroom. Communal areas are great and fully equipped kitchen with FREE coffee all day. Staff is nice and will help you book any tour or buses you want.   Cons: hard pillow, loud bell ring @ night that wakes you up everytime someone walks in.', \"Coming from Guatemala, it weights heavily to give a poor review to what I have been told, was one of the best hotels in Antigua. For $100 a night, a bit more, one expects great service....on the second day of our stay, we didn't sleep in the night before as we were coming from a huge wedding in town and stayed at the after party house. The guy at reception didn't allow us to drive the car to the parking lot inside the hotel saying that it was almost noon and time to vacate the property. We had to argue with him in order to get a shower and time to pack our belongings! I have stayed in most of the five stars hotels in Antigua and in none got such service upon departure. On top of that, the hotel was almost empty. The laziness or whatever got into this guy was not nice at all. He\", 'My boyfriend and I arrived at the Casa de los Suenos at 8am on a Friday. Although we knew it was unlikely that we would be able to check in that early, we did expect someone to be at the hotel. We waited outside for 30 minutes, while repeatedly knocking and calling our travel agent. Finally someone answered the door, and we were shocked to discover that there were 3 bellmen waiting right inside the door, just none of them decided to answer the door for us. We dropped off our baggage then, returned at 3 to check in. When shown to the room, we soon noticed that none of the electricity was working. I went outside and told the concierge and he flatly stated that the whole hotel was without electricity (which they did not mention at check-in). He said he expected power to return to', 'I had originally booked an airbnb in Antigua but had some difficulty with the property so ended up staying here.  The place is absolutely stunning and surprising!  You have no clue what you are walking into from the street.  We attended a wedding here and it was very romantic and beautiful . They were a little rigid on their rules and the wifi was lacking but the staff was friendly at all times.  Check in time is 3:00!  There was not much room for flexibility until we pushed even though we were shown which room would be ours and we saw it was already clean.  The wifi was able to connect with the internet but we were not able to receive texts or calls via wifi.  We had much better connection and were able to receive texts and calls via wif when we visited local cafes.  All in all', 'Not a fan. The gringo volunteer staff were incredibly unfriendly and unwelcoming, barely even greeted me. One went on loudly about how it was okay and funny to call things he didn’t like “gay.” I felt unwelcome as a gay guest. He can do what he likes, but he’ll lose this gay’s business in the future. Maybe there’s been better volunteers at other times. I’ve been traveling for a while and have volunteered at hostels in Guatemala, so I feel comfortable saying that the service here was unusually unfriendly.   Not enough space to sit.  Patio was undergoing renovation when I was here, so can’t speak to that. Nowhere to hang my towel to dry. Rooms are just beds and lockers. No guest access to kitchen, despite advertising kitchen access. Beds were comfortable, blackout curtains were', \"If you find absolutely no pleasure in sleeping then you have come to the right place. The only explanation I can find for the camp 1 room is that it was made by an insomniac seeking revenge. It also gets a little chilli at night and the light blanket they gave you at the third bunk bed doesn't help at all... you can hear every truck, car , motorcycle, bicycle, person, animal and soul that walks near the hostel. And when a car passes the street the bed even shakes a little making it even worse. And on top of it there are people early in the morning leaving for the tours making noise and talking loud with zero consideration for us (at least the staff should tell them to be respectful with the hostel people who are TRYING to sleep (keyword: trying)). I remember when I was coming\", \"My stay at the Base Camp Hostel was ok, and the price was very good value.  The bed was comfortable, the showers warm and overall a clean hostel.  Drinking water and breakfast is provided.  I stayed in a four person dorm, I was so glad I didn't stay in the room with beds 3 levels high as it would be annoying and difficult to climb to the top all the time.  Access to the kitchen would of been appreciated outside of the times the staff were preparing breakfast, and playing loud music from 8am surely is too early for most people.  Having to hand over your passport for the duration of your stay is ridiculous, not even the hotels keep your passport in Antigua and it was a hassle to get it back when I was leaving.  Many volunteers work here so the level of service varies a lot\", 'Antigua is by far the cheapest city of Guatemala. Very touristc and therefor mostly overpriced. This place however is really a good deal. Rooms are small but clean. It´s resonable centric and the roof terrace is nice to sip a beer. The warm water shower is very small, but the water is very hot.... Good place to stay if you want to explore Antigua.', \"This Hostel is really well situated and it isn't far from anything. The staff was really helpful with all of our questions. We had the room right next to the bathroom which mean we could ear a lot of noise whenever someone was taking a shower.

There were 2 different ladies that worked the front desk..one was very friendly and helpful (i don\\'t remember her name but i think she was german), and the other one was friendly enough but not very helpful. I asked the less helpful one for directions to a story once and she just said \"go into town and ask someone\". not very helpful.

Dirty, noisy, just plain gross. Someone smoking outside our room. 'Night Guard' snored so loudly that it woke us up at 4am. Beds were nasty- evidence of bed bugs. Bathroom dirty, we spent as little time in there as possible. One night of my life I will never get back. Reservation made by individual we were traveling with, he got an earful about it.

It's located a short distance from the Central Park, which is just far enough to ensure your evenings will be quiet and great for sleeping. The hotel itself, on the inside, is quite pretty!   The door is secure, with the front desk man locking and unlocking the gate as people come and go. Even late at night, he'll wait up and let you in.

If you have a lot of luggage though you might want to choose another room as the stairs up are narrow and twisty!  The location is excellent -- just a block from La Merced and the Arch street where many restaurants and vendors are.  If you are doing any tours or excursions, work with Mario to book them as he knows best and makes it incredibly easy!  He helped us book a few hikes and tours and only works with locals who give a good price - you can trust you're making a good\", \"Don't buy any services, tours from this hostel - they're a scam. We got a transportation from the hostel to go to Belize over Guatemala City. Once arrived to Guatemala City, there was no bus available to Belize lol. We had to purchase a whole new ticket to Belize. When we called the front desk, they didn't really care and help. Bad service! The hostel itself was really loud the whole night, you couldn't sleep. There's definitely better hostels in Antigua.\", \"I would not stay here again. The dirtiest filthiest hostel I have ever stayed in. We had a private room with bathroom right at the base of the cafe skybar stairs. Couldn't lock your door from the inside. For the outside we had to lock our door with a padlock as the door handle doesn't work. The sheets had all kinds of stains on them and the pillows were mouldy.

We only stayed here out of pure desperation as my partner was really sick and needed a private bathroom close to our bus drop off. \", \"Surprised by all the positive reviews, because this place was definitely not clean when we visited. The dorms smelled strongly of mould so we switched to a private, but it still smelled and we only stayed one night. Wouldn't trust the floors anywhere in bare feet.

Nice garden also for a chill at night!', \"We had two nights at this hotel which was very nice, really well decorated in a rustic style with lots of beautiful greenery. It is situated in a great spot with plenty of restaurants close by as well as the central plaza. Unfortunately our room was off the main courtyard where breakfast was served so it was VERY noisy in the morning. There was also a big tour group staying at the same time as us which probably made the noise level worse.  There are plenty of other room choices away from this area so don't be put off the hotel because of this, just keep it in mind when requesting a room. Breakfast was ok. \", 'We were only here for 1 night and this is a good, central location for a brief tour with reasonably quiet rooms (except for some fellow guests) set around a delightful, central courtyard. There is no restaurant but there are plenty of places to eat round about and the breakfast was adequate.

Nice little bar with small events, every night. Please note bar closes at 10!  Rooms were nice enough, and had lockers for bags.  Only thing I thought was a bit weird was the bathroom having the frosted glass panels so you could see what the people in the bathroom were doing!  Owners were nice and friendly and helpful too, but if I were you I'd get rid of the frosted glass panels lol, and as always some hooks in the bathroom would be nice! \", 'Prices seem to vary with seasons.

I stayed in a room with a private bathroom. It was incredibly cheap (100 Quetzales) and included breakfast. Breakfast was eggs, bread and coffee (or tea). The room was fairly clean--and the shower had hot water. So I really have no complaints.   Wi-fi was also included. The reception wasn't very good in my room--although maybe the wi-fi reception was better in other parts.   If you're looking for a cheap, no-frills place to stay, this is a good option. There is also a travel agency in front of the hotel--so you can plan other trips around Guatemala.\", 'The hotel in Antigua was ok.  It was clean, but towel exchange was 1-2 times in a week.  Wet towels did not dry.  The owner needs to learn a little bit about how to treat people.  I never felt welcome.  She seemed to be a bit of a grouch.  Others were friendlier.  Getting in late at night was a bit of a problem,  in getting someone to open the door.  A front door key would have been good.  The price was good.  The location is a 5 minute walk from the central park.  Overall I would rate it good except for the owners attitude that really spoiled the experience for me.', 'Located downtown next to the Central Park. Clean and spacious rooms with plenty of hot water. Only negative, would have loved a mini fridge because of lack of ice. Make sure you get a room with a terrace, great view! Breakfast was wonderful and staff was very accommodating.', 'Really good value. We stayed here twice in 4 bed dorms. The pod style 4 bed dorm is much better.  Great kitchen. Great free activities. Cheap beer in the bar, although we didn’t like the bar, it smells like cigarettes and doesn’t have much room in it to sit. The garden area is really nice though. Dave who works there is brilliant. Goes above and beyond for everyone.  The bathroom bins aren’t emptied enough for the amount of people that were staying there. ', 'We stayed here for 2 nights and thought he hostel was great.  The rooms have large lockers to put your bag in and the rooms are spacious. The showers are super warm too.  There is a really great area to chill out in.  Only issue is the car noise. As the hostel is on the main road, one of the dorm rooms backs onto this road. The traffic can be quite loud. Remember to pack earplugs and you will have no issues.', \"I stayed here for two nights while I was traveling around Guatemala. It has a great central location, very close to parquet central. My room and the hotel itself were always very clean and the bed was pretty comfortable. I was quite happy staying here, and a solo female traveler the main things I want, well most travellers, are clean safe and a good location and this had all of that. I will echo some of the other comments about the noise coming from the next door pub, I heard it but it wasn't so loud that it bothered me. Though I admit I was at a disadvantage being unable to speak spanish the staff were still very helpful. We managed quite well with my limited spanish and their english. Due to the my language issue I am still not sure what the deal with breakfast was. Overall I\", 'Quite cute and snug, but no different to most other \"Courtyard\" hotels in Antigua. Friendly staff and fairly clean, but there are so many nooks and crannies around the place you can easily imagine espying insects scurrying along the floor, although in fairness,  I didn\\'t see any. But now it goes downhill. The buffet breakfast looked very unappetising with cheap ham and fruit that looks like it gets taken out and put away each day until eventually it is eaten. But the worst bit was my room: room 10. It is right next to the bar next door and you can hear people shouting and everything else. Music thumping away until after midnight. And I was there on business so wanted some rest. Really horrible. Also it looks over the front of the hotel so you get street noise as well. Thank God,', 'This hotel is centrally located at the northeast corner of Parque central and yet it is quiet from all the hassle and bustle outside. Beautiful & clean swimming pool. Rooms are spacious, clean and nicely decorated even with fireplace. However, rooms at the ground level facing the inner courtyard are a bit dark and might get noisy in the morning when other hotel guests pass thru the corridor and chat loudly. It might be better to opt for the rooms at the upper level. This is a popular hotel so you might want to reserve your favourite room way in advance. Walk in rate might be cheaper than the online booking rate. Price is a bit on the higher side but it is well justified with the good service, room and location. They also serve good buffet breakfast.', 'We booked the volcano hike from here so stayed before and after. Over all, it’s a pokey little backpackers with fun decor. The beds are like little cubbies with curtains. They don’t have private rooms but do have some double cubbies in shared rooms. The lockers are too small to fit two people luggage in however and the floor space is non-existent in some of the rooms which makes things very awkward. They don’t do breakfast but they do black coffee. And the jacuzzi is sooo good after the hike!', 'The title says it all.

They know how to follow rules, but you can\\'t make a rule about kindness. I see some good reviews here, but all I heard from the people staying there was \"well, it\\'s only for one night.\"   The \"free cake\" thing is a joke.

Long, long forms to fill in on arrival (reminiscent of what hotels used to do decades ago), including disclaimers about the small amount they are prepared to guarantee if you use the hotel safe ($100 - why ? What is the point of offering this service?) and, worst of all, telling hotel guests that they will have to wait FORTY minutes to have breakfast.  We were told we should have reserved a table !

For example the second time we stayed there we arrived at 7am and we were leaving the next morning at 2am so we asked if we could get the breakfast that day since we weren't gonna get it the morning after our stay. They said that it wasn't possible but we could have bought it instead....we had the right to one breakfast and they refused to anticipate it to the previous day, not really a sign of nice customer relations! Also we had to re-collect our passports from the reception the night before as we were leaving at 2am.

I've read reviews here that talk about how friendly the staff has been, but my friends and I found the volunteers working while we were there to be unfriendly, stand-offish and disrespectful. When asked questions, they 1. did not provide helpful answers and 2. seemed inconvenienced that we asked questions to begin with.

It has nice decor and is located about 5 long blocks from the Parque Central.  We thought we would give it a shot, but many of the hotels in Antigua are similar to this one - nice decor with small rooms.  This is the architecture of the era - no large suites unless you want to pay $200.  The service was courteous and everything was clean and tidy.  Having stayed in many hotels in Antigua this did not stand out among the many as anything special.', 'Arrived at the hotel and once situated in our room, there were several things that we noticed right away. First, there was an unpleasant odor. This odor worsened when the water in the bathroom was turned on. The \"bathroom\" was very small - I could wash my hands, empty my bladder, and (almost) take a shower without leaving the same spot. There was no air conditioning but this isn\\'t the worst thing in the world as the temperatures were not hot. There was also a dog somewhere close that continually barked for about two hours (up until we left the hotel to find some friends). Hot water was available if you were willing to wait 5-10 minutes. All in all, it just left a lot to be desired.', \"We really loved this place.  It's charming, and our room (the second floor suite) was very clean, beautifully decorated, great view across the rooftop to the volcano.  Karla's English is good, and she was very helpful, arranging rides for us and answering questions.  She's not a native of Antigua, so we didn't find her the perfect person to help us plan our day, but she gave us brochures and helped us track down information.  The rooftop is a fabulous place to spend an hour or two with a beverage and a book - the most amazing views of the city, of gardens, of the mountains. No complaints about the shower as I saw in another review - my husband took a cold shower because he turned it the wrong way, but I turned it the right way and had a lovely shower.   Breakfast was very good,\", \"I was so disappointed in this hotel, that we only stayed there an hour. I told my husband that I didn't care what it cost, but we had to find another place to stay. We were the only people there. No one spoke English. We couldn't get the wifi to work. You had to let the water run for 10 minutes before it got hot. There was a dog howling non-stop for the hour we were there. Sounded like it was locked up somewhere close to our room. They want payment in cash. No Credit cards. BEWARE!!  I do not recommend this place to anyone!!\", \"I have stayed here many times since 2010, both as a Peace Corps Volunteer on vacation and as a tourist. I like it a lot. It is perfect for the budget traveler or backpacker who just wants some basic comforts. Although it's basic the rooms are not sparse - the decor is kind of historical, rooms are very clean, with hot showers, cable TV, free drinking water- so well worth the money (around $25/night currently). The rooms are dark, particularly downstairs, but there is a nice patio upstairs. I know they wanted to add a kitchen but that was pending when we visited. It changed owners within the past year or two, but it is basically the same- the new management clearly values good customer service and the attendants are efficient and polite.  I'm not sure if they speak English though\", \"I have stayed at Hotel Burkhard a couple of times and can't recommend it enough.  You will not find a better deal in Antigua.  We payed 150Q a night.  The room was small, but had two beds, cable television, and a private bathroom.  The shower had hot water that stayed hot the entire time (not always the case in Guatemala).  The hotel was clean, and the owners were friendly.  There is a small restaurant at the hotel too, but we didn't eat there.\", \"I stayed in this hotel during a night out with friends in Antigua. It'd been recommended by others who said it was nice, clean, and a walkable distance from the main plaza.The affordable rates, laundry service, and friendly owners were also major selling points, but when I walked inside, I immediately knew I'd gotten exactly what I'd paid for: bugs, mold, and an uncomfortable night of no sleep.  I wanted to like this place so badly because it is very inexpensive and the friends of friends swore by it, but as we were getting ready, there were roaches actually crawling up from the drains and out of the sink.

Unfortunately, during the night I noticed\", \"Overall this is a pleasant place to stay - it has a beautiful roof terrace and fantastic staff. Also has great WIFI. However the beds were a nightmare (we stayed twice). This place could be excellent if it just had good mattresses - arguably the least any hostel should have is a bed where sleep is possibe. It's falling into disrepair and some of the bedroom windows are broken (mosquito attacks!). All very simple to fix - it would be so amazing if they did.\", 'Dorm rooms are comfortable but a little tight for room an some of the lockers need replacing.

Both my boyfriend and I got quite sick when we were here (we think from Semuc Champey). They were so helpful. Moved us to a private room for no additional cost even though they lost the business for the dorm beds we were in. Called doctors for us as our Spanish is poor and even offered to attend the hospital with us to translate.   The hostel is the definition of value for money. Quite basic but comfortable and clean. Kitchen is decently stocked. On the quieter side regarding atmosphere but suited us perfectly.   Booked our tour to El Salvador from here and got the best rate we had come across.   Would highly recommend! \", \"Very basic hostel. Rooms are comfortable and cool enough. Has a kitchen and small lounge where you can watch tv. Toilets and showers were alright, although there was trouble with one of the showers because you couldn't lower the temperature.  Staff were friendly and nice as well.

Good sized lockers so you can tuck all your things away and don’t have to have your belongings on the floor.  Exceptionally clean.  Good kitchen so you can cook your own food.  Chill atmosphere but still social.  I have to say the free coffee was very bad, which seems a shame in a country that produces so much beautiful coffee. However there are cafes very nearby where you can purchase a cup of decent coffee.  The volunteers were unfortunately a bit snobby. One in particular I found talked down to people who didn’t want to “rave” or party all the time. I think it will be of benefit to the hostel when that volunteer moves on.

The room sizes vary, those on the ground floor (with direct access from the patio) are big (some 30 sq.meters) and the upper floor ones are approx 20-22 sq. m. - strangely, the hotel tariff does not reflect that.

The bathrooms are not the cleanest - during my 3 day stay, the bathroom was cleaned once and we had to ask for the bins to be emptied as they were overflowing… The staff are friendly and the manager in particular is really helpful.  The main drawback is that this hostel is NOISY. The 'common area' is right outside the rooms so anyone chatting there can be heard by everyone and the bars above and beside the hostel play music until the early hours of the morning.

He also did all the right things as a manager to improve the security and assured me that he took this matter very seriously.   Be aware that if you book this hostel, there are no locks on the rooms so it is open to the public to enter if they are not detected by security.

There were prominent patches of mold on the walls of our room.  Water was unavailable on one of the four nights we spent at Shalom.  On the days that water was flowing, warm showers were available.  Shalom is located next to a small residential enclave.  Every day, we were woken at 4:50am by a neighbour blasting Spanish talk radio.

Something basic like emptying the bins and changing towels would be sufficient. Also breakfasts are different every day but what you get for example is cornflakes/pancakes and coffee or tea. Again, perhaps a glass of juice would be nice in the morning.

The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were clean. The showers were hot! Breakfast is included in the overnight price, and the typical Guatemalan dish was delicious. However, the coffee could have been stronger!   The only downfall to this hostel is that the staff is made up of volunteers. So depending on when you stay, the experience could be made better or worse by the particular volunteers. I would suggest finding a travel agency around Antigua to acquire information becuase the staff was uninterested in answering questions. In addition, one of the rules of the hostel is to respect other guests by keeping the volume at bay while others are sleeping.

The location is great, on a quiet street just around the corner from La Merced and about a 10-minute walk to the central plaza.  His rates were about $25 a night, compared to\", 'spent 1 night after completing a mission in guatemala city. the hotel was clean. It has hot showers. breakfast was ok.

There is a pool but the hours of usage is short.', 'Tropicana had an undeniably buzzy atmosphere, with drinks and games being played every night. The staff were enthusiastic and friendly and the hostel was an easy place to make friends.

The hostel provides tours and shuttles which were good value for money and very enjoyable.', 'One star because it is a good place to party... but a good party does not mean a good hostel in general. The prices for tours and buses are more expensive than all other places in town for no good reason. There is a lot of noice at night so don’t expect to sleep well. Staff is friendly but they are not able to keep some sort of order in all the chaos. Conclusion: 1 star for the party, 0 stars for the rest of the hostel.', 'Three monkeys is a good hostel.

There is a swimming pool too.  There are long outdoor corridors all around so you can sit and relax outside within the perimeter of the hotel itself.  Has an old, rich,  colonial feel which was lovely.  Staff was friendly and informative.  My only gripe is my room was on the street and it was noisey.  Tried to find a different room but they were booked.  Try to get an interior room if you go. The breakfast was just ordinary.', 'Just recently I took a group of students from UBC Canada to Antigua to study Spanish and we stayed in Casa Del Parque. The service was phenomenal and so was the location! The pool was kept always clean and everything else in the premises, the rooms were nicely decorated and quiet if you chose a room that isn´t facing the street and traffic. I will have no problem returning to this establishment.', 'The staff was very friendly and attentive. The environment of the hostel was lively and the staff surely adds to it. They plan events during the week to bring people together. With this said, if you are looking for a quiet hostel to stay at, this is not the place for you. People were up drinking and loud until about 11pm-midnight every night we (my boyfriend and I) were there. This did not bother us at all, but just as a warning for people who may be looking for something different.   Quick tip: Pay the extra $$ to stay in a room away from the road. It was so loud that it was difficult to sleep through the night hearing the cars bang along the cobble-stoned streets. The other rooms away from the road are much better!

We went out to dinner and drinks and came back around 10:30PM.  The music in our room was super loud from the bar/restaurant next door. We went to the front desk and asked about the music.  We were told that they turned it down at 12:30AM and off at 1:30AM. We asked if we could move rooms but we were told that they were full. The music did not stop until after 2AM and it was not quite in our room until closer to 3AM. The room had several sky lights and we were wide awake by 6:30AM.

Every time we returned from a day's outing or whatever to Posada Juma Ocag, we felt we returned home. The rooms are very clean and well appointed with lots of outlets, comfy beds and ample blankets, and each room (that we stayed in) had a cabinet that could be locked. Having a 24-hour reception desk, and who had to open the door (after we ring the bell), meant that sitting in the half-courtyard and terrace was relaxing. The wifi worked great.

Our stay there was excellent.  The room was very comfortable and clean.  We had a wonderfully cooked fresh breakfast each morning with fresh juice and hot coffee with the morning sun beside the pool.  All the amenities were actually functioning including Internet and an awesome jacuzzi.  Of special note was Abby at the front desk who was always there and ready to help us.  We very much enjoyed our stay at the hotel and the city of Antigua.  Thanks to everyone, Michael & Pamela', 'We stayed there for 4 nites in February 2013.  Looking for a hotel with a pool etc as we needed a break from the budget hotel regime.  Website says hottub, pool and sauna.  Well the sauna has a broken door and it looks like its used for storage.  The hot tub water level was low and covered by a plastic tarp.  It looked dirty and needed cleaning.  The pool was nice but the tiles need cleaning.  Lounge chairs around pool look like they are ready to fall apart.  Our room was nice but again the sink looked like it had not been properly cleaned (stained badly) for a long time and it was noisy.

And a tv room is also next to the rooms, and the tv is very loud too. No respect for others. Also they kept our passeports for the Acatenango trek, and they couldn’t find them when we came back. They did not give attention to this problem. Keep your belongings with you! I had to verify myself the office to find them.  But the Acatenango trek is amazing with this hostel, very well organized and the guides are great. this is the only one advantage of this place.

Staffs were also pretty helpful to navigate the town and offer suggestions.  However, I never had a good sleep during two nights stay because the bar was always loud with people drinking and talking till late night (they closed the bar at 10pm but people still stayed) - one time, people came back from party at 4am and kept chatting until 6am, even if I asked them to quiet down.  I read the reviews saying that this place is not a party hostel, but it was more like a party place than a quiet place. The place is full of typical gringos...  Also wifi was horrible - getting on the Internet was a pain.\", \"We stayed only one night there and it was enough.   When we arrived there was no water and the guy at the reception desk told us that we'd have to wait approx 3-4h to get some. Considering there is a convinient store near, it is not that bad. But when you advertise you have free water to provide... you should make sure you do have water for your guests.  We tried to relax a bit but the open space is so empty (like 8 sitting places total) we didn't find seats.   So we thought we'd relax in our room... beds and pillows are far from comfortable and wifi was weak.  Speaking with other guests, we realized that wifi was weak everywhere. I'm not the kind of person to complain about that kind of things but seriously they have 5 or 6 different wifi and none of them are powerful enough...\", 'Food expensive considering it doesn’t have a kitchen  Rooftop terrace is great and does a good happy hour, also has a pool.

The rooms are basic with springy beds, some charming old wooden furniture and small en suite bathrooms with a shower with great water pressure.

They quoted me a price for a triple room ($50US) and asked me to reconfirm at the beginning of December.  I just wrote them back and they say the price is now $60 and they simply said sorry, the last minute fares were just that.  What's the point of reconfirmations?  Just so they can raise the prices?  It's not much, but I feel it's wrong for them to be able to raise prices when you're just reconfirming your booking with them.\", 'I have been returning to this lovely hotel annually...7 years or more.

The hot water during my stay worked in the morning but was non existent at night. The rooms were not very well cleaned.

However I would say you could do much better for a similar price even if paying a bit more.\", 'I loved this hostel. Nice rooms with ensuites and hot showers. We were even allowed to use the kitchen facilities to cook our own food. The place has so much character, with stunning views of the volcano from the terrace.

It was walking distance (10-15 mins) to all of the main sites in Antigua and allowed us to see some additional fun, interesting shops that we probably wouldn't have seen had we stayed in the very center of the city.  The hotel could be considered akin to a hostel, but it was just what we needed. The room was clean, we had a private bathroom, cable, and wifi.

We stayed in the double-bed tipi, which is upstairs from the dorms.

Only one thing i didnt like in the dorm was the noice. The chickenbusses leave really early to the station at 5am or something, which is really loud! Also, you can hear every sneeze or sigh from every other person. The fans are making a lot of noice as well.   The staff is extremley friendly! Theres free coffee, you can make your own food, the terrace is nice. We definitly will come back when in Antigua!', \"This is a nice, cheap hostel with friendly staff and a very casual vibe. We stayed both in the dorm room and in a private double and the beds were comfortable in both rooms. Dorm could use some extra storage as people's luggage was all over the room and it was quite messy and crowded. Showers were hot with decent water pressure and the kitchen is small but well equipped. Rooftop terrace was a nice spot to hang out on but unfortunately when we were there the bar was closed indefinitely due to complaints from neighbours. A real shame as other guests told us that it was quite the place to be. As others have mentioned, the bakery down the road is amazing.\", 'This hostel was really cheap (50q per night in dorm) and had a nice roof top with a view of theerupting volcano Fuego. Also a bar upstairs.  I slept in two different beds, first one was horribly uncomfortable with metal strings sticking up from the mattress but second one was all good. The dorm upstairs had no where to put bags so everyone put them in the narrow isle which made it very messy, people lost stuff due to the mess.  Over all a good place, not too quiet and not too party. Really cheap, warm showers and friendly staff.', \"Somos is such a frustrating place to stay.

Pros: - Unrivalled mattress comfort. - Superb, private pods with a light and a charging station. - Spacious lockers. - Clean. - Good, warm showers. - Decent kitchen.

With it’s smiling staff you feel at home right away. The beds are really the best in Guatemala, and the small cubicles are actually cozy. Just the privacy you need.  This is not a party hostel, so you are very likely to get a good night sleep and new friends hanging out it the small common area near the reception. They even got hot showers!  They arrange tours to Acatenango and provide you warm clothes as well, which not all the companies do. And believe me; You’ll need it. Who would’ve thought a volcano could be SO cold a night, right?

I was up all night having to listen to the hostel workers friends have sex in the dorm room.  The hostel has strict rules of no Guatemalan visitors only tourists. I went out for dinner and came back to the female receptionist and a sketchy looking Guatemalan guy laying on the dorm room floor in front of my bed. Neither of them were even staying in my room.   The volcano tour was supposed to be a English guided tour and I made sure of this because I speak no Spanish.

Exercise facilities were small, hot tub was barely lukewarm, Dining facilities were not that visually appealing and would have been nice if the opened them up to the outside more. Very much enjoyed our stay and felt the value was good. We would probably stay elsewhere in the future like Porta which we stayed on the back side of our trip.

It’s within walking to some of the best restaurants and shops in Antigua. If you’re into rustic archaic lodgings this is the hotel for you.

Personally, I’m not a big fan of this style of hotel but I do appreciate the uniqueness and history. The hallways are pitch black at nights which was a bit creepy.

The breakfast was by far be best we’ve had, with very attentive staff topping up the buffet with fresh fruit, waffles and scrambled egg.

Only downside was the ‘walking tour’ offered at the hostel which is not really a tour and more of a walk around town pointing out bars and restaurants with almost no information about Antigua.

The sink had a water filter system for drinking water which we used to fill our water bottles during our stay. It was very quiet at night.

We had asked for a room on the top floor in the back courtyard to avoid any breakfast noise in the morning and got a beautiful room just as requested (I think it was 205). While there is not a lot of natural light in the room itself, we found the bathroom lovely and light due to a big skylight. The only disadvantage is that rooms are a bit stuffy (with hindsight, we should have asked for a fan) but we found that keeping the window open (they have metal grilles in case you are concerned about security) pretty much took care of the problem.

The location is great, right next to several good restaurants (try Toku Baru) and bars like the infamous Cafe No Se. Cons: no outlets in my dorm room so if I wanted to charge anything I had to sit in the common area, it's also close to a church which holds morning mass at 6 AM and rings their bells at that time (which woke me up every morning).

I was getting Dental work done near by and was going recommend I can not do this now. Pay at your own risk. But enjoy Antigua.', 'I have stayed here a different time over the years and I have not been disappointed.  Love the breakfast to get your start for the day.  I enjoy the gardens and going to the top of the building will take your breathe away.  Take a bottle of wine a carafe of coffee and just enjoy.  I have been in most of the rooms and never had a problem.  The stars at night are amazing!', 'The staff was kind, but spoke ONLY Spanish.  The single room downstairs are to the back of the building.  There is only one small window over the shower.  Mold is all over the walls, sheets, showers.  If you have allergies, you cannot stay there.  It is VERY dirty!  The front rooms are larger, not as much mold but also dirty.  We lost something and looked under the bed, unbelievable the dirt we found!  They need a new housekeeper!', 'The Burkhard is an extremely comfortable place to stay, and I have come scarily close to living there at times. The owners, Hugo & Sheny, are incredibly friendly and have helped me out of a jam before.  I recommend this hotel for people who plan to stick around for a while and need a home base in Antigua. Pros: the showers are great (not using an inferior electric calentadora, as is common with cheap hotels in Guatemala); cable television; clean; safe; and you can steal WiFi from the hotel next door if you sit on the second-floor patio. Rooms can also be appropriately dark at all times if you are hung over or have a stomach illness.  I do not recommend this hotel for travelers who are looking for somewhere \"cute,\" \"authentic,\" or centrally located. ', 'The good:  very nice staff, awesome wi-fi, nicely decorated rooms.  Very clean  The Weird: no separate bathrooms.  Toilet and shower were part of the bedroom.  There was a notice not to flush toilet paper in the toilet, but the wastebasket had no cover, therefore, smells came into the room.  No fan and no window to open in the toilet area.  The bad:  walls were paper thin.  I heard one half of an hour conversation of my neighbor trying to find his lost luggage.  When you pay with a credit card there is a 10% fee, which happens to be prohibited by the agreement with the credit card company.  To ad insult to injury, they only accept dollars as payment, so if you pay with a credit card, they first translate your bill into the dollars are the highest possible exchange rate.  A', 'I found the hotel to be a bit pricey for what it had to offer. The rooms smell owful from the cleaning detergents and the breakfast was lame, for the $5 you could eat outside, plus they served the same thing every day. The staff was nice and helpful had not knowleadge how to book activities or the main attractions in the area which I thought was very odd giving the fact that that is their job....None of them had any idea of what good restaurants are around or what are the top attractions around Antigua or how to contact them.....bizarre. Also the pool is not heated so hope only for the hot tub as the pool was rather chilly', 'Simple, small, clean, modern. It is also well located, a minute walk to the central park. I would definitely comeback.', 'Me and my wife just got married , but we decided we didint want a normal honey moon with luxury hotels and expensive stuff , so we decide to stay in cheap hostels and travel for a longer time!

Highly recommend this place to stay !!', \"We stayed here for 2 nights. Good hostel, breakfast was delicious. Happy hour is good before going out to dinner (beers 10Q). Room was good, beds not the best as very soft foam, but adequate. Showers are hot. Don't think the owner was here while we were as there didn't seem to be much happening in terms of cleaning and emptying dirty linen bins etc, but no problems, good on price point, and the day trip and overnight trips were great value compared to other places prices.\", 'We stayed here in a private, great, spacious room. Cool hostel, nice brekkie. Great rooftop terrace.  Downsides for us was the blonde American guy that works there was really rude to us when we arrived (there were four of us). Just unnecessarily rude and blunt.  And only other negative is the guy above played music loudly in the hostel from 7:30am in the morning. Bit early and annoying.  On a plus side we met another American guy that worked there later in our stay and he was very friendly and welcoming. ', 'As others have said, Mario is what would keep me coming back.  He was super fabulous with all of our silly questions and with minimal Spanish skills (me) it was great to be able to get information from him in English.  He must have arranged/booked at least 5 things for us.  The man knows who, what, when and where.  His housekeeper is super sweet and you can use the kitchen whenever you like. We also found it a little difficult to sleep but earplugs take care of most of that.', 'This small boutique hotel located in the heart of Antigua was a perfect fit for us.  Built around a central courtyard, with an incredible rooftop patio, this hotel was very quiet and intimate.  Carlos and Louis at the front desk could not have been more helpful.  From arranging tour guides, shuttles to the airport  and suggesting places to eat, they always were accommodating and helpful.  We had a suite with a fireplace, which was larger than the other rooms and very comfortable.  The hotel is only a block of the central plaza. And we walked everywhere.  We visited during Holy Week, so the processions went right by our hotel at times.  It always felt safe and protected as all the festivities blossomed around us.  Thank you Meson de Maria for a great stay!', 'Antigua has changed quite a lot since our first visit back in 2008 - inevitably it has become far more crowded and far more touristy.  There are now many hawkers and also people begging and sleeping rough in the main plaza.  There are also Range Rovers, Porsche Cayennes, designer dogs and large numbers of heavily armed police.  It’s still a good place to visit, though the light and weather is critical.  If the air is hazy or cloudy and you can’t see the massive volcano, Antigua loses its uniqueness and becomes just another Spanish colonial vestige.  And it was just like that on our visit - the result, it seems, of another smoking volcano.  Antigua has dozens of boutique-style hotels and this time we stayed at the Meson de Maria. The rooms all face inwards which makes them a', \"This was one of our favourite hostels throughout our whole trip. It's well located and is a short walk to the centre. Everyone told us the supermarket was far away, but it's only about a 20 minute walk (fine for us). There was a shared kitchen that was very well-equipped. Each room was given a basket in the kitchen to store their food and we had full use of all facilities. We were also given free tea and coffee, milk and purified water whenever we wanted. The staff were very friendly and always available to help us. There is a rooftop terrace (but you can't get internet connection here) that has hammocks to relax on. However, the wifi connection was very strong in other areas. We would definitely stay here again.\", 'This place became somewhat of a second home, as I found myself back there throughout my whole trip in Guatemala. I liked that it was a little farther away from the \"city center\" than other hostels. It was quiet, but still had a lively atmosphere, depending on the crowd that was staying there. Sometimes we\\'d have small parties on the rooftop, sometimes we\\'d watch movies in the TV room, sometimes we\\'d go to bed early, and wake up early to watch the sun rise with a cup of coffee on the rooftop terrace (a nice highlight). And, it was cheap too! The beds were not the most comfortable I\\'ve ever slept on, but that wasn\\'t all too important for me. The kitchen was clean, had a good amount of pots and pans, but was a tad small. Just have to wait your turn to cook. We managed well though.', \"If you're in antigua, you're not gonna stay in your room for long  This hotel offers you a decent room for average market price with private bathroom.

You can also book a shuttle to Atitlan Lake from the hotel (reasonable price - 10USD)  Staff is nice and helpful \", 'The good:  We arrived before the scheduled check in time, but our room was ready, so they allowed us to check in early. The room was very nice, but also very small (room #5). The bathroom was very clean and the shower water was nice and hot. The bed linens and towels were clean. They had two robes available. Breakfast served on the upstairs patio was the best food we had in Antigua. The grounds were very well maintained. The staff were great! The evening before we were to leave on an early morning excursion we asked if it would be possible to have some coffee at 5:45 AM. At about 5:15 AM we were up and happened to check if there was any coffee available yet. They had a pot of coffee with two cups sitting out waiting for us in the sitting area of the lobby.

First rate staff. Very kind, always available, and genuinely invested in making our stay amazing.  I will return and I highly recommend this to fellow travelers.', \"Well appointed boutique hotel just five blocks south of the main square. Both common areas and rooms are decorated with much style and local antiques. The staff is extremely courteous. Breakfast on the pretty upstairs terrace.  I found the room's soundproofing a bit poor. At 4 AM a family with children checked out loudly at the front lobby (close to my room) and I couldn't sleep through it. Also easy to hear other guests coming in and out of neighboring rooms. Poor shower pressure in my room. But overall, pleased with my experience and believe it is a fair value. \", 'This hotel has u truly unique experience. The premises with the musea is so big that you can easily spend like 1-2 hours on it looking at all the beautiful things. Rooms are great and spacious and there are comfy beds. From the outside of the hotel you will see a small door, but when entering..wow! The spa comes at a charge but is worth the visit! Only one (but big) remark: the majority of the staff lacks service attitude. For example: when we received after one month (!) a notice just before arrival that we were booked in a smoking room, we tried to change that. We could not reach the hotel from abroad by phone and tried all communication lines: email, skype, skype messenger, FB messenger and even twitter. So far there was not a single response to any of them! The same for an', 'It was a very friendly and nice place to stay. The rooms are normal, nice and clean.  The staff is great and they were very kind on keeping our backpacks for some days while we moved around.  Muchas gracias!', 'Edy Chiquito, It was a terrible waiter who charged us for more breakfasts and an additional buffet only for an extra fruit dish that one of us ate, this was because the a la carte breakfast was very poorly prepared without the ingredients mentioned in the menu and Eggs without cooking well, as requested... Too bad experience!', 'I recently spent a total of 7 days here (over two different stays) and have to say I really enjoyed the experience.  My companion and I got a private room with our own bathroom, and I kept the room after she left.

There is also a nice common area that has a television and seating, I had some great conversations with fellow travelers here.

It is in a good, safe area, one of the more interesting parts of town, with boutique hotels, ruins of cool old churches and expat bars (the trendy sky bar is in the same building) within walking distance. The rooms are very clean, basic and comfortable, with a decent hot water shower and great value for money. The staff is very considerate. There is also a travel agency out the front, with whom I booked an internal flight and got a better price than the internet. There is a small garden out the back. Basic breakfast is included. The communal area needs some work - there is a pool table and tv, but few comfortable chairs and a lot of junk lying around, so doesn't feel very homely.

Rooms was very romantic and spacious (we had the junior suite upstairs) with a super comfortable bed. Breakfast was delicious, number of choices available.  Only complaint was the mix up with our arrival. Booked flight from Tikal to Guatemala City in advance with the hotel and they also arranged the pick-up from the airport to the hotel. When we arrived at the airport there was noone there. Waited a good 20mins then asked to use the phone at the airline to call the hotel. Turned out they were waiting at international airport rather than the domestic one (you would have though they'd know since they arranged the flight).

Our room was lovely, the bed was wonderful, we had a sofa on the terrace right outside our room overlooking the gardens downstairs, we had great wifi signal in the room and our ensuite had a bath with jets.  We did find the website a bit misleading - there is no communal jacuzzi, you only get one if you stay in the more expensive suites, the \"heated pool\" is really a shallow decorative fountain and was stone cold when we were there - nice to look at, no good to swim in!

The hostel was great - clean, original use of spacing, great little outdoor area and close to your its attractions and a number of amazing restaurants in Antigua.   My favourite and most stand out thing about the hostel was the amazing staff. They were SO friendly and helpful. They didn't stop smiling the whole time we were there, no matter how early in the morning or late at night it was. They gave us the best recommendations for local restaurants and cafes. Were generally lovely to chat to. And really did help us and save our skin a little when it came to some issues we had with our bank cards and cash being stolen at the boarder crossing. Tania went above and beyond any level of service\", 'Somos hostel is a very beautifully designed hostel. The place is clean and as a pretty garden.

The staff are a serious credit to the hostel, especially Elliot who is incredibly helpful. The rooms are cheap and clean. Only issue we had was that we paid for the volcano tour, and were told the hostel doesn't take any commission but some of the people on outlet exact tour had paid 75Q less than us. Not a big deal but it's worth looking around town for the best price.\", 'Nice staff, nice ambience and nice surroundings! Everything is clean and organized there. They explain everything to you with patient. Highly recommended guys!!! There are local people staying in as well so many chances of practice your Spanish ;)', 'The two nights in central city was well served by choosing this hotel.  The staff was outstanding and helpful, room was very pleasant, and the tranquill courtyard and pool added value as well.  The included breakfast was very adequate.  WiFi an added value, too.  Also knwn by its former name Hotel Azul, it still had this on the website.', \"We stayed at Hotel Casa del Parque the first week of September.  It is in a fantastic location, just steps from the Parque Centrale, so it's an easy walk to just about everything.  With its pretty courtyard, pool, jacuzzi, lovely views from the second floor, and big, comfortable, clean rooms, the hotel is a fine value. They provide a hot breakfast (only one option) and some self-serve choices which we enjoyed once, but then ventured out to breakfast places nearby with lots of choices and more people-watching opportunities. One caveat that other travelers have noted is loud music at a club next door.  We complained, and the hotel not only bought us a free dinner at an excellent restaurant, but had the club disconnect their sub-woofer, so getting to sleep was no longer an issue\", 'I stayed here for 4 nights . Arriving very late after a flight from the UK and they were very friendly.  I was amazed by the volcano view the next morning. Room and bathroom good.  Breakfasts good and no restaurant but restaurant opposite was excellent.  Also no bar, which was surprising, but the hotel provided a beer when I asked for one.  Only a 3 minute walk to town centre.  Highly recommended.', \"The Meson de Maria is very attractive: arranged around 2 courtyards and with a roof terrace with stunning views. We had a 'suite', the best of their rooms, which was really just a good sized room with a large bathroom (complete with Jacuzzi and skylight) and a tiny outside seating area screened by potted plants. The standard rooms looked to have quite small bathrooms. Breakfast was a bit disappointing with a limited choice but it was nice that there was a tray with complimentary tea and coffee (and biscuits sometimes) at various times of the day. Hotel is very close to the main square and restaurants, bars and sights. A good option for Antigua which is a lovely town.\", 'I found the room small, but clean. It has excellent free Wifi and CNN among the tv channels, which is very  important for me. But I stayed at a room Next to the courtyard which I did not like at all because I could hear everybody and everything which happened in the courtyard. The breakfast buffet is Limited. It is a small bar at the hotel.', 'A good stay in this nice, quiet hostel. The rooftop terrace has a great view. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The Harry Potter bathroom was amusing. WiFi was very good in the common area. 200 characters required.', 'I called up the hotel in order to make a booking for the following night, for 2 nights. I called up in the evening, at about 6-7pm. I was going to be travelling the entire following day until I reached the hotel. The hotel person I spoke with booked me a private room for 2 nights. So far so good. Then I received a phone call at about 20:30 - 21:00, saying the room I booked was in fact already taken. They had no rooms available. The error of the hotel was not major, but I had to urgently book a room at 21:00 at night, and I had a bad experience.

The rooms are inexpensive, and the beds (at least in the room we were in) are comfortable. The rooms at Casa Luna also have TV’s (not that we eve turned ours on), but we know that Casa Luna gets US TV channels because we could hear CNN and other American programming coming into our room from other neighboring rooms.

The second room literally opened up into a small courtyard off the kitchen, next to a very loud water pump.  (They turn off the pump at night due to the noise, which explains the lack of water pressure when you take your morning shower).  The room was VERY small, with the shower located on the other side of the room from the rest of the bathroom.  It appears that the charge was the same for the two rooms.

Beds were comfortable, dorm had locker (bring your own lock). Shared bathrooms were clean but when the place is full, there was some competition for the bathrooms.

Same story with drinking (and cooking) water - this place was not immune to the city-wide water problems (mid August 2017.)

I do share the comments on the size of the rooms and bathroom, very small and you barely have space to walk inside them.

The rooms are nice and cozy with foam mattresses which aren't crazy loud when someone on the top bunk needs to move. In the end it's really helpful to have a hostel staff that will give you advice and help you make your trip a little smoother. Thanks so much Basecamp!

The rooms are beautiful and clean - super charming and full of Antiguan character.  The city has a bit of a European/Guatemalan fusion feel and so does the hotel. The hotel arranged pick up for us at the airport.  The driver had a sign with our name on it and was right on time.  This was extra, but totally worth it, since at $40 it was about the same as a cab ride anyway.   The breakfast - which is of course included in the price is delicious and varied.

Note, however, that there is no \"restaurant\" per se; just a kitchen for the staff to prepare breakfast.  Needless to say, if you\\'re sick or it\\'s raining or you simply want a coffee or other beverage or snack, you\\'ll have to walk about 10 minutes.

There was only one PowerPoint in the 8 bed dorm I stayed in and there were not enough shared bathrooms for the amount of people staying there. Showers were cold. Staff were friendly and helpful although I felt that they got annoyed when I did not book the specific shuttle they recommended - due to time constraints I had to travel during the day and they made it very clear that they prefer people to book the night bus, which under normal circumstances I would have rather taken anyway.

The private room we stayed in was nice and airy and the view up on the terrace was pretty amazing.  Unfortunately apart from that nothing really stood. There weren't really enough bathrooms so you often have to wait. The kitchen is small and was left dirty every single day (obviously its up to people to clean after themselves but sometimes that just isnt enough). Finally the staff were all helpful enough but there were a lot of them with a few close friends also staying in the hostel meaning you felt a bit left out of a close knit group, who often crowded the bar.  None of these things made it particularly unpleasant but due to the huge choice of hostels in Antigua I find it hard to give it a higher rating.\", 'This is a nice little unpretentious hotel, just a half block from the park and a very short crawl from good food and drink.

There are soaked towels laying on the floors, loads of dust in the rooms, the bed had a spring missing, and  the sheets looked like they had not been washed in a year.   People mentioning it being good value? Well I can name other hostels that are good value and clean and the same price.  On a positive note, the rooftop is nice and I guess you can do laundry .

The double rooms are big, there is also a kitchen, a TV room and a nice terrace bar. The girl at the reception is very helpful and she can book a lot of tours and sguttles for you', 'Villa Esthela is situated a little far out from the square, but also in a little quiet neighborhood, a little sketchy at night from my perception. The guard the night we arrived was kind enough to upgrade us from a dormitory to a private after a 17 hour bus journey to Antigua. The place itself is clean and quiet, and has a nice upper deck with a view of the city below.', \"Don't underestimate this hotel when viewed from the outside, it is like a designer Tardis inside. It is ideally placed to drop in and out of whilst walking around Antigua, plus you can get your bearings from the roof. Reception is trendily rustic, then you are through to the first courtyard where a very wholesome breakfast is served with good choices, plus there is generally a pot of coffee on the go there. We were in 106 which was in the rear courtyard with loads of seating places amongst the shrubbery. The room was a good size with two double beds and a feature fireplace. It  was a bit of a 'galley' bathroom but it had a tiny bath with a very powerful over shower and loads of hot water. The towels were softish and for the first time on our Central American trip there was body\", 'This is a charming little hotel straight off one of Antigua’s streets.  The rooms are set round courtyards, with seating areas outside the rooms.  There was a feeling of peace and calm about the accommodation.  While the room was on the small side, it was more than adequate for our one night stay, with a well-equipped bathroom.  Wi-Fi was available and free.  Breakfast was on the sparse side with scrambled egg, refried bean paste and a tomato sauce, with some bread and fresh fruit.  It was obvious that a party had just finished breakfast, as the platters were quite empty with the staff slow to refill these and the empty coffee flasks.  If the breakfast service and selection improved, it would be a very nice place to stay.', 'The location is perfect - central for a walking tour of Antigua. Add to that an excellent buffet breakfast on an outdoor patio, pleasant and clean rooms, interesting décor, and a terrace with stunning views of a smouldering volcano.', 'Pro: cool communal areas and jacuzzi is a bonus! Big fully equipped kitchen and big fridge available. They cancel your night if you hike the volcano which is considerate. Stayed in the 6 female dorm ensuite and thought it was small, no hot water in shower but at least we have power outlets near each bed. Possible to book any tours and shuttles to other cities.   Cons: location is outside the main square, about 15 minutes walk, shower in the ensuite female dorm did not have hot water, booked a bus to San Pedro and they dropped me off at Panajachel and I had pay 25Q to take the boat on top of the 95Q. Thankfully, after reading my review on HostelWorld, they gave me a refund right away which is much appreciated and shows that value customers. Thank you!', \"Far away from center of town so walking at night was a bit sketchy alone, cold showers and to top it off rude staff.  Checked in everything was fine until the next day when they inform me that I have to move rooms every day, which is not a deal breaker until the owners attitude got the best of the situation about the cold showers and not taking responsibility for this employee not informing customers about moving rooms.

We stayed in room #1, and it was a queen bed..the King beds are across the stone walk way over water...our room window had wood doors to close so the room was completely dark, the shower was a good size and great water pressure. someone posted that the room was small, well while it isn't big there is seating outside by the small pool or up on the roof that overlooks the city and where you have breakfast. a few mornings I needed my coffee before I could face the world and they brought a tray to my room..the hospitality was great and I would love to stay there again...\", 'The facilities in this hostel were very good, coffee and water on tap, all the usual kitchen and bathroom facilities,  lovely garden and sun balcony as well as friendly helpful staff. Security was high,   We had an enormous ensuite room, the only fault was the poor lighting but we managed.  An enjoyable stay.', 'Was recommended this hostel and was very disappointed. Toilets weren’t clean, dorms were packed and very little room to move (and to leave bags/valuables). Acatenango tour very expensive and better elsewhere, just shop around and see for yourself. On the plus side rooms are quiet at night and guests were considerate of others.', 'I had a discount cupon and ended up staying in the hotel for a very good price! however if it wasnt for this i would have been a bit dissapointed!

The grounds were kept VERY clean and the flowers we beautiful. It was also very close to the park and within walking to everything we needed. But there was serval things we did not like. Our room was nice, the beds we comfortable, but the drains did not drain that well, the sinks let of some kind of smell that was not good, (they did try to fix but was unable to) the breakfast was not worth the $35 we paid a day for our family.

At first we didn't want to bother with moving, but we were so glad we did! At 180Q for a double room upstairs, it is an excellent value! The hotel is very well-run and managed, everything is very clean and well-maintained. There is a terrace on the second floor which is a nice spot to relax. The room was cheerfully decorated and felt very clean. The bed was very firm (which we have not had a lot luck with in Latin America). Nice linens which fit the bed.

We also came pretty late around 1am one of the days after the cocktail party walking back to the hotel and felt very safe. The hotel had a museum as a plus, and it’s interiors are restored from the olden times. I would say it was an absolutely unique and one of a kind experience for us!', 'I left my travelling companion alone for five minutes and he managed to get us expelled from this excellent hostel.    He had already annoyed the Israeli manager of the Hotel Zoola who told him to find somewhere else. I thought we were fortunate to get beds at the place next door: pleasant helpful staff, quiet, good facilities, nice spacious dorm, reasonable price. The only real drawbacks were that the kitchen was no longer available for guests and that they insisted on keeping our passports throughout our stay, in both cases for security reasons.

All the guys were peeing in water bottles because of the insanely long waits in the morning.  Other than that, this place is really not very clean.  I really wanted to like it here because the staff were extremely friendly and helpful (and the showers were hot!) but we still had to switch hostels after a couple days because of how gross the place was and because of the bathroom situation.

Also they will not store your bag for an Acantenango hike unless you also book it with them; even if you make a reservation to return!

There's a rise in hostels in Antigua that offers pods or modern bunk beds that offer you more privacy than old fashioned ones. The beds have their own power outlet, a light, and a curtain to close. It's a great system to have more privacy and at the same time be able to read comfortably in bed without disturbing others. There's a big courtyard and a good kitchen to cook in. It's central enough, just a block away from the picturesque Plaza Union.  Although compared to some other older hostels (such as the Three Monkeys and Tropicana) it's a lot better in terms of cleanliness and noise, there is a little noise from the street. You can easily tell when it is 6am when the Chicken Buses start picking up from Antigua to Guatemala.\", \"Where do I start? Finally a hostel that doesn't pride itself on the stereotypes of the dirty backpacker!   This is backpacker luxury!   Each pod has a curtain , light and charge station!

Locks and towels are provided for free!   There is a kitchen and entertainment area which is clean and well equipped! They are in the process of building a terrace!

The owner is quite nice and helpful. Tv room has lots of DVDs, wifi is fast, showers are actually hot. Visitors are allowed until 10 pm. On the downside, the hostel is located out of the way, walking back late at night isn't a great idea. Also, bunk beds are covered in plastic, which can get pretty loud at night. Not a party hostel, but a great place to chill.\", 'A pleasant place to stay.  Nothing to exciting, but solid.  The rooms were clean and a good size.

It's a nice place in the Gravileas, a few minutes walk north of Antigua. It took us a bit of time to initially find the place because of its location: we walked into a gated area (the Gravileas) where some extremely friendly guards checked our ID's then let us into what can be thought of as a beautiful and expansive gated community with at least two large parks, it's own central area with a nice fountain, and colorful, gorgeous, homes and flowers everywhere.  We stayed in Villa 21, which is a two bedroom villa with a spacious kitchen, dining room for six, washing machines as well as a wand-wash sink, and a large living room with a fireplace.

Excellent for spacious room, new facilities as bathroom with good counter space in the bath.  Nice shower.  Staff very accommodative on breakfast choices.   Downside to hotel was that it is about a 20 minute walk from the city central.  Walking at night could be a problem so we used a taxi from downtown to hotel at night ... about $US3 to $4.

It felt very secure with the front door always locked - you ring the buzzer and someone let's you in (there is a night guard on duty).

Rooms have floor-fans, which is plus and not always common in hotel rooms.  Small kitchen in the hotel that guests can use is great. Free coffee in the morning!

Perfect for those people who look for a quiet stay and for couples who want a romantic and more private setting.

For the room prices, you can get a more abundant and varied breakfast.', \"I have traveled to more than 40 countries now, always staying in hostels, and this was the first time I saw this abuse. We got into arguing with the owner because we didn't take a shower the day before neither take breakfast the 2 days we were there and they were charging us this money. We were just back from Pacaya volcano, all dirty. How will a hostel charge people shower after check out if the main attraction is a volcano around the city? At the end, he didn't force us to pay. I recommed you to see Mexico City Hostel policies to learn more about what is a true, helpful hostel. There, they gave us free shower and breakfast BEFORE and AFTER check in - they were really great. In this trip we did from Panama to Mexico, Guatemala was the country in which people most tried to fool\", \"The hostel welcomed seven of us late at night so we could get out of Guatemala City.  The hostel is in a good area with a pretty chill/relaxed feel to it.  They appear to get most of their revenue from the volcano tours they operate...which look fun.

Unfortunately, it seems that by taking us in, the voided somebody else's reservation...but it all worked out.\", 'I came to the hostel early in the morning. The owner showed me around the hostel and I immediately noticed he was a little bit special. He was somewhat insulting, and I would quickly get my first impression of him confirmed.  One of the guests were in the shower, and the hostel apperantly has some problems with the shower getting flooded so that water leaks down to the reception area. The manager would talk loudly asking who the \"idi*t\" in the shower was, and also talk patronizingly to the girl in the showers friend. He banged the door to the shower and screamed at the girl in the shower, terrible behaviour and not a way that you should treat your customers in. Get the shower fixed instead!

At 7am I was awoken to the sounds of a group of people hammering the roof.  It was the building next door but it sounded like it was takening place on top of my head.  I asked the front desk guy what he could do.  He looked at me with the most vacent of eyes and shrugged his shoulders.  Here are some ideas if you want to run a hotel.  Maybe go ove rthere and ask them to wait till 10am.  Or maybe give the guest a free 5 dollar breakfast.  But alas they couldnt care less.

It was on the road which was noisy and as anyone could look in, you couldn't open the window which was an issue as it was hot and there was no aircon. The room itself was tired, especially the bathroom which was tiny.

Things got off to a bad start when the private transport we arranged in advance with the hotel was an hour late picking us up at the airport. We had to borrow a mobile phone from a stranger and call the hotel to see if anyone was actually coming to pick us up. No one ever apologised for our inconvenience. 2. Then when we arrived and were shown our room, we asked for more lighting as the room was so dark you could not see what you were doing. On the third day of our stay different light bulbs were put in the ceiling light. This made little difference to the lighting level of the room.

On checkout, we grabbed our cameras, wallets, i-phones, passports, etc., and boarded a bus to our next stop. Sadly, I didn't inventory everything in my wallet before leaving... and only found that I'd been relieved of my hidden stash of $500 the next day.

It is very close to the Central Square.  There is a large variety of room types, which are nicely situated around two attractive courtyards.

Staff were helpful.', 'Stayed for a night in shared 8-bed dorm room with private bathroom. Dorm was basic, clean; I found only one electrical outlet so charging my phone required some coordination. It was a very economical stay, and served its purpose well, but in the high-ceilinged, bare-walled, tile-floored room, every sound echoed, the bathroom doors creaked noisily and i felt I was either being disturbed or was disturbing others every time the bathroom was used. They had just recently opened at the time of my stay, so maybe the rooms feel a little warmer or cozier. The staff was friendly, accommodating and excellent, speaking both Spanish and English.

For one night that would have been OK but we ended up feeling cramped. We recommend travelers choose one of the larger rooms if staying longer.

This means that if you have a question, you are required to trek to the reception desk. This \"trek\" was a bit difficult because we had to walk over rocks (round cobblestones) to get from our room to reception.

The reason that we are giving this hostel a 3 star is that we were disappointed with the level of cleanliness in the bathrooms. There are 3 bathrooms which include a shower and toilet each in the whole hostel. We found that in the first 24 hours we were there they were cleaned once.

Great central location', 'Loved the communal area in this hostel. It was excellent for chilling out, having a complimentary morning coffee and soaking up the Guatemalan sun. Great for a group of friends. The camper van and plane were cool and the staff were all really friendly.   The showers were temperamental and it was a lottery as to whether or not you’d get a cold or warm shower. Walking through the outdoor communal area from the showers to the bedrooms in a towel isn’t ideal but most travellers don’t care about that type of thing. There were lots of sinks, toilets and showers which is the main thing.  The Wi-fi was hit and miss for a few of us but worked most of the time apart from when the power went, which can’t be helped.

Antigua was our first destination in Guatemala, and my wife and I felt that this place was the perfect place to stay. There were several things which we really liked about the hotel, and a few things we though can be improved upon.  Let me start by describing the hotel as a very quaint, romantic, rustic, adorable (as my wife would call it) residence with a very personal feel. The property is very comfortable and inviting, and the staff at the front desk were very helpful and friendly. We found the overall service at the hotel to be 5-star, and accommodating.  We stayed in the rooftop suite, so unable to really comment on the other 9 rooms on the property. We absolutely loved', \"We had a great stay at Casa Encantada, It's a small boutique hotel with a beautiful garden and small pool. You get the feeling that you are in one of the old colonial homes of Antigua. The delicious breakfast is served upstairs on the rooftop, where there is also a bar for afternoon drinks. The rooms are spacious and seem very private. The windows open up to the street but inside you feel miles away because of the thick walls.    There's a nice little living room  that leads through a water garden to another room. We didn't stay there but it looks neat. You use stepping stones to get to the room.\", 'I just came back from my second trip to beautiful Colonial Antigua,Guatemala,and stayed at the lovely Casa Encantada.

There is a peacefulness about this hotel - no one is in a hurry, no one is rushing around.  You enter the hotel and then it opens up onto courtyard after courtyard with several covered walkways that are otherwise open to the outside.  You do not hear the hussle/bussle of outside - it is quiet and peaceful within the walls of the hotel  There are maybe 3 rooms in each area and then the next set of rooms is separated by another walkway to more rooms.

They pack you in and with so many people you do get woken up early when the tours leave and I felt like out of every place we’ve stayed that hostel is solely focused on the business and money so not much on the travelers experience.  They were not so flexible with travelers bookings. I do understand there are policies but every hostel has a policy and many of them were willing to be flexible as most travelers plans tend to change. The joys of traveling!    When I left Antigua I didn’t anticipate that I would be returning but due to a last minute change of plans I did return and needless to say I did not return to Tropicana.

It’s a ‘party hostel’, which here translates to ‘we’ll charge you more for the opportunity to not sleep for a full night because there are drunk/drugged up spring-breakers wreaking havoc’. The ‘pub crawl’ starts at 4pm at the hostel and within an hour the place is like a zoo (I.e imagine monkeys throwing faeces). They pack you in like sardines (triple bunks).

The rooms are basic but clean and comfortable with private bath/shower - though you have to know how to work the sometimes erratic shower-head heaters common in these parts. The rooms also have some basic furniture in which to stow your luggage but have no A/C. They have no TV either but its unlikely you will miss this as Antigua has so much to offer.

We didn\\'t have hot water though, which was a bit of a pain. At best it was lukewarm, even after it had been \"fixed\". Still, at 140Q for the room, it was good value.  The staff is friendly enough but I have to say that the owner, Maria, was not at all flexible and not particularly accommodating.

The drawbacks for this hotel are: 20 min walk to Central Park, challenging plumbing with having to flush toilet several times, lukewarm shower water and the lack of window screens allowing insects into room. Second year in a row we stayed here.  Will do so again next year. This is Antigua and plumbing is always an issue.', 'Casa Santo Domingo is a special place that combines and old monastery with new pieces of art and great gardens. It is worth a visit and a stay. Rooms are colonial and have a beautiful chimney. The moment you enter the premises you can feel the peace of this special place. The hoel has many facilities for conventions or special celebrations', 'Our room was nice. Beds were comfortable. Very clean. Coffee was provided at the end of the hall each morning. The shower leaked on the floor. Air conditioner was a bit loud. We could hear people upstairs partying. Staff very nice.', \"If I had one piece of advice when choosing which hostel to stay in Antigua it would be to choose a hostel with a terrace. Due to being a town surrounded by multiple volcanos, it's pretty nice to have an area like the Terrace has to offer where you can chill, eat and drink with a view of Antigua. The Terrace offers transport and activities at the best price you will come across which really added to the stay. Our budget room itself didn't have a fan which we probably would have not chose if we're informed of this - however I'm sure the pricier private room wouldn't have had this problem. \", 'Not super clean but okay. Nice staff! Little bit a party hostel so there will be noise. The breakfast is included... but it is so little that you will order another breakfast anyway. They offer the vulcano climb acatenango for a good price Q150 and at the park you pay Q20 for the reserve.', \"We really liked staying at Cucuruchos. The staff are friendly, the space is very new and clean and the breakfast in the morning is delicious. The beds in the bunks are nice as they have privacy screens, personal outlets and lights. Good location. A bit of a walk away from the center of town, but it's literally next door to a delicious restaurant so you have a lot of food options.   They offer a shuttle pick up service from Guatemala City if you are flying in, but it's a little over priced. You can find shuttles at the airport that will drop you off anywhere in Antigua for $12 a person. Also, the three stories of dorm beds are a little intimidating at first. If you have an issue with heights, specify that you want something closer to the ground.\", 'My wife, 10 year old son and I spent 5 nights at the Casa Encantada over New Year’s 2008.  We enjoyed our stay, and would recommend the hotel to others.  We stayed in the rooftop suite.  It was comprised of a single, largish (compared to the rest of the rooms) bedroom and a large (by any standard) bathroom that had both a shower and a whirlpool bathtub.  Both the bedroom and bathroom were bright (2 large picture windows facing the Agua volcano on one side, 3 smaller windows overlooking the rooftop terrace on the other).  The linens were of first quality, and the bed (and pillows) very comfortable.  Our son was given a cot, which he pronounced very comfortable.  The bedroom had two easy chairs for reading, and a corner fireplace (we never used it).  There was a small, one-chair', 'Clean. Friendly. Laid back. Good place to stay while you visit Antigua. Antigua is an Excellent place to visit. Highly recommend the hiking in the area as well as the local eateries. Don’t miss out on Valhalla, an eccentric macadamia nut farm with exceptional pancakes. Trust me on this.', \"Went with a tour group.  Pros - good location not far from central park, good laundry service comfy beds with privacy curtains. Lots of toilet cubicles  Cons - mosquitos everywhere, especially room 1. I used bug repellent and still ended up with 10+ bites appearing overnight. I thimk you should get mosquito nets for the beds. The showers range in temperature and gave electric shocks occasionally when touching the valve. There were rumours that someone in our group saw a rat - not sure how true it is but not surprising if so. You have to pay for towels and while its only a few dollars, i have never been to a hostel that charged before. Very open design of hostel with no keys for rooms, and the lockers in the room aren't that sturdy - i reckon a blunt object could easily open it\", \"This is a very charming hotel with wonderful service.  It's beautifully decorated and the breakfast was delicious. Although there are only 6 rooms the hotel wasn't full when we were there but we were placed in the smallest one I think.  We could barely move around - it would have been fine for 1 person.  We were disappointed because the room next door was empty and much larger.  However, we didn't realize it until we had unpacked.  The staff couldn't do enough for us. The bar next door is irritating but we could still sleep.\", 'This hotel is the best if you like a vintage style, very cozy and beautifully decorated, it has a really nice roof terrace where you can have a relaxed breakfast. The staff is very friendly and accessible. The only problem is that the hotel is located next to a bar and in weekends tends to get very loud, I stayed in the last room \"El Carreton\" (No. 6) and you can hear everything like you were right in the bar.', 'Stayed here for 4 nights. Great location.  It’s a busy hostel, great for young backpackers (I’d say 30 and under). Rooms are okay, hostel is clean. Also has a pool and upstairs rooftop terrace.   Food is good in the bar.  However, I think the staff (many of which are backpackers) could do more to socialise outside of their group especially with solo backpackers to help make them feel welcome. Maybe the hostel could organise more group day activities? Reception staff were super friendly.   I would stay here again and would recommend their acatenago volcano tour. It’s well organised, great food and they also have their own private camp with a toilet which the other providers don’t offer. ', 'Great location to stay in and excellent owners. Very friendly with cats and also a rabbit! You have fast wifi too. Free breakfast to start off your day. Great suggestions from the owners if needed and genuinely interested in getting to know about our culture. Quiet place to sleep at night. The kitchen is well equipped to make your own food! Over all, a great place to stop by.', 'I found this place by accident. it is near the market and really cheap. It seems to cater mostly to Israeli guests since they were a bunch of them there. The rooms are not special and old bedding/beds/everything lol. They do offer a kitchen to be used by guests that is always taken by someone. The owners are cool, they offer free tomatoes to cook, so that is nice. They do have annoying dogs running around and lod ppl at times since the walls are paper thin.', 'Lovely hotel with lots of its original charm still present. Rooms were ok with plenty of room to sit and take in the ambience on the various terraces. Roof top gave good view of volcanoes. Bathroom room was equipped with a shower that produced a real deluge and the biggest skylight i have seen. Staff were helpful and breakfast was a typical Guatemalan affair. It was well positioned for exploring Antigua.', 'rooms a little smal but as we were in the room just to sleep they were finel and the staff and atmosphere  and lovely courtryard  make it a nice place to stay,location is good too.breakfast is ok .beds were comfortable enough for us.', 'This remodeled old home in the heart of Antigua is lovely to look at with its central courtyard and flowering landscaping.  The staff is friendly and helpful, however, the rooms are small and dark and the beds feel like plywood. Rooms are on two levels and like most hotels in Antigua, there is no elevator. When coming home after 10 pm, there is no lighting in the interior, making it easy to trip over the multiple steps up as you meander through the courtyards to your room.  Bathrooms are small and towels are limited.  In fairness, my friends love this hotel, however, I likely will seek a more comfortable bed the next time I visit.', \"We were really looking forward to spending 5 nights here but unfortunately this hotel despite all of its charm, fell short of our expectations in many ways. Enough so that we checked out early and weren't even asked at the front desk why the early checkout or apology. Really disappointing that the front desk is not properly trained nor has any initiative or interest in it's guest's experience and satisfaction. Not a way to properly run a successful boutique hotel.  Positives: The hotel has a great location (across from the delicious & golden-fork awarded La Fonda de Calle Real restaurant) The hotel is small, charming, beautiful details such as: large stone windows, candles, small, cozy sitting areas, fountains, etc. Colonial architecture with lovely details.  Negatives about\", 'This a a very cute little hotel. Everybody is extra nice and always ready to help you. The place is very clean, but if you have a dark room it might smell like a humid room. The location is just great! Everything is close, but not to close. The only thing I would recommend is to ask for a room on the second floor in the back of the hotel. Why? Because you can hear everything that is happening in the court yards and at least in the back there are not so many rooms. Nice place but I would not recommend it for a busy season since it might get to noisy with to many guests.', 'Not to be confused with the “Casa Antigua hotel” on the other side of town.  Couple in their mid 30s, early 40s. No kids.  Overall: Friendly, fun, very old, very antiguan hotel. With genuinely rustic rooms. Large enough space. Comfy beds. Small TV. Large bathroom. With lots of public places to sit and smell the many flowers.  We paid $112 for a Saturday night on semana santa (easter week), when the whole town gets extremely festive, putting elaborate flower/sawdust murals on the streets, and having daily processions marching jesus through the streets. Lots of fun.  Pros: -Cool, old building. -Great location, close to everything. -Bed was womfortable enough. No A.C, but strong/loud fan. -Awesome view from the rooftop terrace (tough to find in the back). We saw a volcano exploding', \"Our first good night's sleep in Antigua in a nice setting but a bit far from the centre of town.  The breakfast buffet was poor quality & value so won't eat here again.  Cheaper hotels elsewhere provided free water but not here.  You can walk into town if you are up for the walk but on a hot day that might be a sweat. Pool is small so 4 strokes from end to end. OK for our last night in GTMA.\", 'I stayed here during the week of \"Semana Santa\", so it was more expensive then it would have been during the rest of the year.  It is a small hotel but the staff is friendly even though most of them do not speak anything but Spanish.  The rooms are wonderful and cozy, but the water is not always hot and you will have to wait for the water to heat up, if people in other rooms are taking showers.  They have a small breakfast menu, but they do not offer anything for lunch or dinner.', \"We were in Antigua for Holy Week and enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel. Large room with 4-poster bed and 3 small courtyards. Great location! The processions go very near the hotel. The service was very friendly and there was usually someone who spoke English. A bit pricey during Holy Week, but that's to be expected during that week. The bathroom could use an update. Overall a lovely hotel that we would absolutely stay in again.\", 'The hotel is really nice, with spacious room, nice bathroom, and nice environment. The location is just wrong as you are outside Antigua, and to reach the centre you have to walk through desert roads.   Although the hotel is really nice, I will not suggest to stay here as there are plenty other hotels IN (and not outside) Antigua.', \"This hotel looks very nice, with the rooms arranged in courtyards but in practise this means noise carries very badly and I was woken up by a group returning to their rooms across the way. The pillows were also quite hard. It is quite a walk to the centre of Antigua which was fine for me but may worry some. The food was pretty good if a little pricey with perfectly adequate service. One of my bugbears is hotels that don't supply a bottle of drinking water when the tap water is recommended for drinking. This one didn't supply water although there was a cooler at the bottom of the stairs to refill bottles.\", 'I had high expectations about this property because of some recommendations from friends but it was just an average experience. The room I stayed in was not designed to work. Although it has wifi there is no desk or a suitable table to set up a laptop or to read. The chair and the small round table available are a torture for the back and the legs. The light in the room is very poor and makes it very hard for reading. The service at the restaurant was good and waiters were always available to help. I appreciated this. The front desk staff were ready to help although not always successful. I tried to book transportation to Guatemala City but they only found options that departed Antigua very late. I had to hitchhike with a colleague.', \"The hotel is very pretty, the architecture and the decor of the room were very nice.

We went for\", 'This hotel had a discount while we were there, but we have since found better for cheaper in Antigua. Our main problem was the noise in the room - you can hear everything through the walls. This disturbed our sleep a number of times. The room was very very small, the pillows uncomfortable, so they could improve quite easily I think. You can find better in Antigua.', \"This place has a lot of potential, which has not yet been met. We had pre booked a double room with shared bathroom, but upgraded to a room with a private bathroom. Here's why; the room we were originally put into was upstairs with one window that looked inward to the kitchen, the room was extremely hot (they don't have any fan's) and we didn't fancy leaving the window open all night as people could see in very easily and the fridge humming was quite loud too. We also learned that the only shared bathroom was on the lower level, down some very steep, narrow, concrete stairs - not a trek either of us was really willing to try in the middle of the night.

Unfortunately, they were booked for the two extra nights we decided to stay in Antigua, so our options were limited. From the entrance, this hotel seemed on par with Casa Cristina, and as it was the same price, we assumed it would be comparable. Our mistake. It wasn't anything like Casa Cristina. The rooms were disgusting--moldy ceilings with paint chipping off, moldy bathrooms that looked like they never bothered to clean them from the previous guests. We stayed in two different rooms, too--and both were equally disgusting. The sheets smelled moldy, too. The staff there was creepy, too. We really did not like this place!  Do yourself a favor and try Casa Cristina next door where the rooms were clean and tidy and\", 'We stayed 2 nights here.  The terrace is nice, the view is great. You can see the volcano when there are no clouds.  The staff is friendly. Rooms are a bit dark but clean.

They have a \"breakfast of the day\", which you get for free - i had pancakes, delicious. Breakfast starts at 07:30 AM - not ONE minute before (that\\'s why I went on a trip hungry, because they wouldn\\'t start 5 mins earlier). The alcohol is cheap and their terrace on the roof is great - a beautfiul view over Antigua and the vulcanos!  It is considered a \"party hostel\", which means you hear party music all day long. I liked my stay although I think there are better choices around Antigua.', 'A clean friendly hostal with helpful knowledge staff. The view of the volcanoes was spectacular from the roof to patio. Hot showers were a bonus. The nice thing about the breakfast that was included is that it changed from day to day.

Breakfast was delicious (the croissants are a nice touch!), and it was great to be able to use to the kitchen facilities - it was the only place that I stayed at during my 2.5 wk tour of Guatemala that had this, and as a Brit who likes her cups of tea, I very much appreciated it!

If you have bad luck, this can be an issue (not in my case).  Staff was accomodating, buffet breakfast reaching maximum 3 stars with no option of ordering a proper espresso coffee (although Antigua Guatemala is one of the best regions for growing finest Arabica coffee beans in the world).

The hotel lost a star from my ratings because they appear to accept group bookings and two nights running we suffered from loud groups (of North Americans, I regret to say) dominating space and shouting to each other.

We went to the volcano tour and were supposed to take the shuttle 2 hours later but the tour came late and we couldn't take it, I asked from the staff to rebook the shuttle because they told us that its OK, but they didn't wanted to book again and asked us to pay again for the shuttle.

Moreover the dorms are really big and so are the bathrooms. It feels like too many people share too many things. ', \"We stayed for 3 nights. It's a very clean hostel with plenty of toilets and showers. Showers are lukewarm. This is a very quiet hostel with little atmosphere - probably best for Spanish lessons or resting after hikes. We didn't use the kitchen but noticed there's no fridge. Beds are very comfortable with curtains, plugs and a light.  There is a very good selection of activities and shuttles available from this hostel.   However there is no security on site.

The room was slightly small, but had all the amenities for a lovely stay.   The four poster bed was comfortable, but was a little too high from the ground for our liking (especially after a nice bottle of wine). The roof terrace was a lovely place to enjoy a relaxed breakfast, whilst viewing the volcanoes in the distance.  We had dinner at Mason Verde, the food was excellent and reasonably priced. For a more informal dinner - try Cafe Mediterrean, which was also very good (Italian food). We thought Cafe Condesa which is located behind the book store, was only average and very over priced.   We would definitely recommend the', 'Stayed here for 2 days after a 2 week mission in San Mateo. We were a group of Medical professionals who were exhausted and ready for some TLC.

I reached out to this hotel to host our corporate event, because I stayed once in the past and I loved it (event though they wake you up at 7:00 am just to check if everything is okay with your room). So I asked the sales department to book 16 guest rooms and a conference room with drinks, food and audiovisuals  for 5 days but unfortunately we got stuck into many issues:  1.

En esta ocasión no me quedé en hoteles del centro, sino busque un lugar tranquilo y lejos de la bulla del centro.  Este hotel es ideal.  No está muy retirado. A 10 minutos caminando del centro. Sus instalaciones son aceptables y las habitaciones son cómodas. Aunque si quitaran algunos muebles el espacio mejoraría. Sin embargo, pienso que está hecho para hospedar a grupos y por ello las habitaciones parecen un poco saturadas. El baño es pequeño pero cómodo. Siempre tiene toallas limpias y agua caliente.

Comfortable king sized bed, with lots of pillows. Breakfast is provided and the terrace has a lovely view of the volcanoes. The location is a a bit far from the center of town but that's what makes this place lovely. It's too hectic in the town center and the car fumes can be overwhelming. You can walk to the town center and all the shops in about 10 minutes, while seeing lots of sights as you walk.   We would definitely stay here again! The staff was kind and all spoke excellent English. Much better than my travel survival Spanish.\", \"The decorations, rooms and terrace, they all are really nice. I liked the decorations since they have some Catholic figures and books about art history on colonial times.  We bought a romantic night trough a third party service, we were supposed to get some wine and chocolate. That day we headed to the hotel 2 hours after the checkin time but the room wasn't ready, the man at the front desk said he was about to set the flowers and all that stuff.  He looked very busy  so we went out for awhile. We came back later, they gave us the room, they moved my car to the parking lot one block away (they offer valet service), but we didn't get the wine nor the chocolate.  Breakfast is included.

We were there for the Easter commemorations and Don Diego fitted our accomodation needs admirably.', \"After my original hotel gave my room away for the week of Semana Santa, we walked around looking for another place to stay Wednesday night...we came across the cute Cafe Don Diego and noticed it was also a hotel.  Carlos came out to greet us and showed us the back room with 4 beds.  The location is perfect- right across from Iglesia Merced which is where all the main processions start and end during Holy Week, and he only charged us $90 a night, which is expensive for Guatemala but NOT for Holy Week.  It is a family run hotel, not fancy but they take care of you and the attached cafe has the best coffee and breakfast for great prices.  I highly recommend this place if you're visiting Antigua.\", 'Stayed two nights in two different rooms. One had four single beds, the other, two single beds. The quad room was of average cleanliness, with a tiny bathroom, with Guatemalan style electric showerhead, which provides for a tepid shower, at best. The double room seemed much cleaner, with an excellent, large bathroom, with a large shower, with limitless hot water. We enjoyed our stay in the double room much more so, than the quad room. While not a bad choice of a place to stay, for the room rate, there are better choices (such as Hotel Casa Cristina, nearby.)  There is a cafe at the front of the hotel, that makes excellent, reasonably priced coffee, cappuccino, etc.', \"This was my ninth visit to Antigua. A friend made the reservations and chose Hotel Casa Antigua based upon its proximity to the main square. I would have rather walked farther.  My room was very tiny and cramped. It had two single beds but no room for your luggage unless you wanted to block the door. Fortunately, there were not two of us, so I could put my luggage on the other single bed.   My bathroom was also tiny, so tiny that the bathroom door almost hits the bathroom sink when you open the door. The rooms surround an interior courtyard, and the windows in the rooms don't close tightly, so I could hear other hotel guests' conversations in the courtyard when I was trying to sleep.   The only positive is that they do provide washcloths - something I found missing at many other\", 'The Hotel Casa Antiqua has the feel of a a little boutique hotel.

It was a large room with 4 queen (or double, i can't recall) beds. It was spacious, nicely-decorated with a nice bathroom area. The only noise we heard were people returning to their rooms later in the evening (just as you would in a hotel hallway, but there is a outside courtyard area where the rooms are located around). The second night we stayed in Room 12 (I think). I was located on the left side as you entered the courtyard hotel desk area. This particular room did have a bit of noise from another room/business. We were able to use a White Noise app on our cell phone to drown out the noise so we could sleep. This room had 2 queen beds and a 1/2 loft area with 2 twin beds.

We slept very well. High ceilings. The marmalade for breakfast was one of the best I ever had in my entire life.   The minus: Almost a mile to the center of Antigua. Since we wanted to walk around town - not to town - to get there we took an uncomfortable slow taxi ride (Q 40/$ 7)  over very uneven  cobblestone streets with plenty of potholes.  Most staff did not speak English or very little - computer translation was used to communicate - worked somewhat - but cumbersome. Often necessary to use my little Spanish.

There isn't much to do inside the hotel, though wifi was the best I had compared to the other hotels I stayed at. The hotel is inside a gated community - surrounded by nice houses and a mini park with a fountain; a nice place to sit during the afternoon to read a book or enjoy the breeze or even go for a jog. The room is very nice and big with tall ceilings. I stayed at room #1 - which is next to a public bathroom so you don't really have a neighbor at one end and above me is the patio. It was a quiet room, but you do hear people from the courtyard from time to time but nothing that kept me up all night. The breakfast was good - chapin breakfast I don't know if some its included with the room rate. My\", \"La Casona de Antigua is in a gated community just outside of Antigua (15 min. walk into town).  The idea of a purpose-built antiqued hotel in a high end gated community did not appeal to me when I first read about it, but at $50/night for one person I decided to take the risk.  It was well worth it.  The property, though relatively new, is beautiful and feels timeless.  Being newer, everything works and is in good condition.  The staff are knowledgeable, skilled and professional.  And the views from the terrace are priceless.  The only weak point is the complimentary breakfast which is a bit sparse, but you do have the option of adding eggs or whatever at a nominal cost.  All in all, this is one of the best small hotels I've stayed at in recent memory.\", 'Enjoyed the Bigfoot hostel and especially the Thursday night beer pong game. Definitely recommended although the breakfast (which is included) is fairly limited both in size as well as in variety. Would go back there anyway.  ', 'Hostel was clean, beds were comfortable. This is a party hostel, so be aware that the music is usually jamming from 9am to 1am every day. We enjoyed our private room, but it was located right outside of the main common area where everyone hangs out, so it was loud early and late.

And we met alot of other awesome travelers staying here.', \"The facilities themselves were clean (besides the hot tub), the bed was comfortable, and it was in a great location. Some serious problems we had were that they bumped music well into the night, we actually got a room across the street for $50 that solved that problem, and the cold water situation in the showers. We didn't even bother asking for our money back but kept the room for the free breakfast in the morning. The hot tub had a weird smell, was a weird color, and had so much little debris things floating in it, you could hardly call it a selling point. Staff was nice and the breakfasts were pretty good in the morning. Overall it was good but wouldn't stay again.\", 'This hotel is part of a chain of 5, we stayed in 3 of them, including Lake Atitlan and Flores. It is a walk out of the centre (20+ minutes). It is delightfully maintained and the staff are very friendly. The inner courtyard is beautiful. I would advise that you ask for an inner room, for both size and peace, as the outer ones do suffer from some road noise if you are a light sleeper. The restaurant is more than adequate and breakfast and evening meals were well presented. Meals could have been a little more \"exciting\" but that is the worst I can find to comment on. There are safety deposit boxes in reception, although the hotel is gated and surrounded by high walls, so is a perfect haven.

Meson Panza Verde is beautiful and has a great restaurant---also a great choice. Posada del Angel has nice public areas but the rooms in Casa Encantada are nicer. The bathrooms are tiny, though.

Lots of bathroom and showers, so you never wait but the tricky electrical shower heads take time to figure out. Kitchen facilities are minimal. No refrigerator to store food and no breakfast. Patio is tres hip with hammocks and people hanging out (and packing since hostel is used by a tour group as their Antigua accommodations) so it can get noisy and crowded. Just blocks from Central Park, so the walk felt safe at night.  WiFi would disappear on occasion and was weak in dorm rooms.', 'Raul is great, very hospitable. Takes really good care of the people that come to his hostel. Breakfast in the morning is a good pick me up. Will definitley be staying here again, especially for the price.', \"Close to the market, it's easy to go visit Antigua from this place and if you're not leaving early in the morning, you could enjoy the breakfast (eggs+bread).

Daniel and Maria Elena were absolutely charming.  Daniel's photographs which are on display throughout the hotel are stunning.  We loved morning conversation with our hosts while sipping Guatemalan coffee and eating croissants.  The view of the surrounding volcanos from the second floor of the hotel are breath taking.  All in all, a hotel with the essence of home.\", \"We only stayed here for one night. Our room was spacious and clean, with a fireplace and lovely, traditional decor. There is a rooftop with a hot tub and tables/chairs where they apparently serve breakfast (we missed it due to early departure). Staff seemed friendly.  The location is just off the central plaza. On the plus side, this means it's right in the heart of everything. On the downside, we could clearly hear the pumping music from the bar/restaurant next door. I slept fine with ear plugs, but be aware.\", 'We stayed at the hotel two nights. The layout is that of an old monastery that was renovated beautifully and turned to both a first class hotel and an interesting small museum. The room we received was large and well equipped. The bathroom was also very nice and provided all the necessary amenities. We had dinner and breakfast, both of which were excellent. The breakfast buffet, in particular, was very generous and tasty. Service was very friendly and efficient. Wifi was excellent. In short, a place to stay in and experience, when visiting Antigua Guatemala. ', 'A nice hotel with a good location. There is several different nice places to sit and relax outdoors in the hotels gardens. The staff members where kind and helpful. Free coffé - but so week it was undrinkable. The cleaning was good.', 'We stayed here  3 for days before we drove to Lake Atitlan and then 2 days afterwards. It was very clean and I really liked the fact that they offer multiple jars of filtered water. They also have complimentary coffee and tea. Very nice patio with pretty flowers. I saw people eating breakfast so they may have food there but I never saw a menu. There is also a Mayan clothing store on the premises. The prices are reasonable and the quality is higher than on the street or at a market. The only negative is that the rooms are quite dark even with a large overhead light and 2 bedside lamps. Also there is no fan in the room but this seems to be normal.', 'Room 16 was quiet and loved the couches out front to chat and relax. Free fresh water was everywhere. Walking distance to everything you could need or want to see. Breakfast was fresh and delicious every am. The little store attracted to the hotel gave us great discounts and custom made a shirt for our friend. Best of all they offered free food for the street dogs :)', 'We are budget travellers and managed to get a good offer for a night in this hotel.  It is beautiful, the only hotel in a residential gated community, so very peaceful and a little away from the centre of town, though an easy, pleasant walk.  We were upgraded to a suite, which was gorgeous: romantic and characterful, with a fireplace and plenty of candles.  The bed was big and comfortable, with good quality cotton bedding.  The bathroom was opulent, with a good drench shower and constant hot water.  Very friendly and helpful staff, too.  The only negative point was the breakfast.  It was served on the delightful terrace overlooking the gardens (you can choose to eat upstairs or downstairs), but,for this price and quality, we would have expected a bit more in terms of choice and', 'We spent three nights at La Casona. The gated, tucked-away location --while still being a short walk from the centre of Antigua -- was wonderful. We arranged an airport transfer at night & Alejandro (our driver) was friendly & informative. The wait staff at breakfast & Jayron were wonderful as well. Our only inconvenience was the occasional lack of running water, but that was fixed relatively quickly on all occasions. Extra perk: rooftop deck with stunning volcano and area views, and an incredible colonial atmosphere. Highly recommend!', \"My daughter and I joined Our Guatemala: Travel with Purpose for a service trip to Guatemala. Our Guatemala made the reservations for accommodations. This week they chose La Casona and I couldn't be happier.  Antigua is a beautiful city and La Casona is in a very safe area near the city. It's a short walk to everything.   Although all of the rooms are different  they all have high ceilings, nice beds and bedding, and great bathrooms.   I prefer the second floor rooms. For the first two nights we were on the ground floor and the room smelled pretty musty. The second floor rooms are airier and have better light.   Breakfasts were amazing. The courtyard is beautiful and the upstairs common area has comfy seating and beautiful views of volcanos. \", \"So, as far as amenities go, this is a nice hotel. Not high-end luxury but nice clean, well decorated rooms. My favorite aspects of this hotel are basics for me...  Quiet. Antigua can be a noisy place when you stay in the centro area. This place is off the beaten path and thus doesn't suffer the noise. On the flip side, if you are 'on foot' then this is a bit of a distance from the heart of Antigua and not on the normal tuk tuk route.  Parking. I have a car here. So, when I'm looking for a place to stay, secure parking is a must. This hotel is located within a gated community. The actual parking area is on the street but that is within eye shot of the 24-hour guard gate and I had no worries about the safety of my car overnight.  This place is a bargain. I recommend it.\", 'Casa Santo Domingo has been an icon of Antigua. It takes you back into history and gives you a taste of what Antigua was. The property is top notch and very well kept. This however does not hold true with the hotel. A $200.00 room that is being sold like a 5 star hotel comes up way short.  The noise level is unbearable, the TV is so small and dated that watching a movie is really not an option. The staff is nice but just unable to overcome the major deficiencies of the rooms. I highly recommend to come for a quick drink but to not throw away your money staying at this overpriced and underdelivering hotel. ', \"This place was fine, but we didn't think it was particularly good value, at Q375 for a double room (though we did talk them down on price a bit; I think we paid Q300). The room itself was nice, quiet, the courtyard was pleasant, and the staff were all really nice and friendly.  On the downside, there was no hot water and the bathroom was quite unpleasant smelling. There was also a lot of Mosquitos around - not something we would usually mention, but it was a bit of a problem as while the courtyard was nice and cool, the rooms were very hot, but we couldn't open the doors because of the Mosquitos. Couldn't sit in the courtyard without emptying half a can of repellant on us. Some citronella or something similar  would go a long way! Overall our stay was fine, but couldn't say it\", 'The owner, Carlos, speaks perfect English and was more than helpful with local info.etc. We found the staff to be very courteous and fun. We had a large room facing the courtyard which was just what we wanted. Street level access without being directly on the street - coffee shop situated in front (served the best coffee!) great Guatemalan breakfast - reasonably priced. The location was perfect - right across from La Merced and a short walk to shops and restaurants.', 'I arrived at this hotel with Caravan Tours. This is totally laid out in colonial style, beautifly place. I had the cutest little room with a sky light!, the one wall inside my room was done in brick and i had a cute little courtyard..  The dinners and  breakfasts were very delicious and they had great funky fruit juices to try!  You can walk from the town to the hotel, which i did alone and felt quite safe. I would definatively return!! ', \"We stayed here two nights on a Caravan tour.  The hotel is charming and beautiful--you feel like you stepped back in time into a nobleman's hacienda.  The grounds are beautiful and the architecure very interesting--different sections and colors.  A second floor dining room and buffet breakfast out side on a terrace was appetizing.  The food was good.  Staff was very friendly and efficient.  Our room was adequate and clean.  The bath was a good.  There aren't any screens on the windows and only a flimsy lock, so I would not leave any valuables in the room.  It is a long walk into town on some dark streets, but taxis are plentiful and cheap.  \", \"The Villa Colonial is a very nice hotel in Antigua with interesting colonial architecture and nice rooms.  The second-foor dining room is pleasant with a view over the courtyard, the staff were very nice, and the food was good.  It is away from the town center, about a half-hour's walk but there is plenty of transportation from town. \", 'This is a pretty hotel within walking distance to the center of Antigua. We found our room to be very nice although many people in our group had much smaller rooms. Food is ok. Would not recommend it to anyone with mobility issue as steps to get to rooms and to dining room. Walk to Antigua center also a little further than other hotels and over uneven sidewalks. ', \"On a trip to Antigua, Guatemala we stayed at the Villas Colonial, part of a small hotel chain in Guatemala.  The city is a UNESCO world heritage site, and although the hotel is not ancient they have done a remarkable job of creating a truly colonial look. We couldn't believe the hotel was only 8 years old! The hotel was hosting 2 weddings as we arrived into what looked like a spanish villa. Apparently couples come from around the world to marry here. The hotel central courtyard has fountain gardens and a small pool. Each of the hotel rooms are a little different with cupolas, balconies,cobblestone streets and courtyards.

There were a couple roosters to wake you up but that's part of the ambiance of Guatemala. We were able to request a fan from the staff.  I've stayed here for a week on two separate occasions.

I can only speak about room 18, which was extremely dirty, had a musty smell and the ceiling (which I did not notice until the night) had a very active termite infestation. The bed cover appeared to be stained when I was brought to the room so I requested fresh linens. During the night I felt things falling on me, many insects were falling from the ceiling, then I noticed things crawling in the bed. The termites from the ceiling were swarming and dropping into the bed when they were losing their wings.

A few drawbacks: the location is a good 10-15 mins walk from downtown (which is where most of the sightseeing is), no problem during the day but at night you'll have to take a taxi back (about $3 USD) as the lighting on the hotel street is extremely poor.   Some of the rooms are located very close to the parking lot and laundry area, so if you're a light sleeper you'll find the noise troublesome (so make sure you ask to stay away from those).  Other than that, its a very enjoyable place to stay at. \", 'Stayed here for a week and it was great. A bit noisy because of neighboring bars but other than that it was lovely.

The facilities are OK – big clean rooms but the location a bit dodgy out of town. We had a room on the second floor on a really sad concrete terrace – no efforts to make it pretty or welcoming.

The hotel itself is beautiful with typical Guatemalan architecture and gardens. The service was friendly even at that early hour. Unfortunately, the policy is that you pay for the room when you check in.

The only things I didn't like about this hotel is that the walls are so thin that I could hear the person in the next room coughing all night and we could hear their conversations.  The room was very bright in the morning due to the outdoor windows so I would recommend an eye mask if you like it dark when you sleep in.\", \"We stayed in Casa Antigua over a total of three nights across a 7 day period and it was a beautiful place! The hotel staff were friendly and wifi was amazing (you don't know what you're missing until you spend sometime in a smaller town or village!).

The place is well-kept, with a lush tropical garden and beautiful architecture. The view on the volcanos is beautiful, although not easily seeable from the dining area and the rooms, we actually inspected three of them before picking our one. The set-up of the room was the main problem, together with the crowdedness of the common grounds such as the restaurant due to concurrent events taking place (e.g. business meetings).

Its literally less than 1/2 block away from the cathedral/main plaza of Antigua.  The rooms are good just don't expect some high end quality room/beds. I'm only trying to set expectations here. Note there was no A/C unit in our room but they gave us a fan and you don't really need the A/C in Antigua anyway.  The roof of the hotel has a great view of one of the volcanoes. I think this adds value to the hotel.  I interacted with all staff during my stay there (day/night/graveyard shift) and they were all friendly and attentive to my requests/needs.

The hotel itself if very picturesque and atmospheric.  The staff are helpful and although it is difficult if you have no Spanish, we got by. However, the reason I cannot give this hotel top marks is the lack of cleanliness in the bedroom and bathroom.  The valance was grubby and the sheets and towels although clean were very threadbare.  There was dust on the all the skirting boards and the whole room could have done with a clean. The bathroom needed a really good clean, I don't think the floor had been washed behind the door for a very long time.  I ended up cleaning it myself, rather than let it bother me on a daily basis.

The bathrooms were kept clean and the water was always warm in the showers. wifi was pretty good especially upstairs. The Bar on the terrace was small but good.

The hotel appears popular with Central American tourists and offers very clean rooms, decorated in a simple but entirely appropriate style.  The owner is friendly, and some of the staff speak English, though others don't. All are friendly and welcoming.  I would recommend being armed with some Spanish if at all possible.

There are some hotels in Antigua that don't have a parking space, so in the end it's better to have your car in the same building you're staying.

And the room was as booked, a quad with two doubles and two singles that were up a long ladder in a high loft. Nice and clean, too.   However, there some real challenges here. Foremost is that the sound insulation/dampening between rooms is practically non-existent.  We could hear the boy in the room on one side coughing all night, and every word spoken by the man with the deep voice on the other.

Also (and I am sorry to have to say that) the staff is kind of reckless, very noisy at night time. We had to tell the staff it self to keep it down after 10:00 pm.  I did not enjoy my stay at this place and I definately not recommand it to other travelers.', 'Sitting square on to Volcan Agua, the Terrace offers possibly the best view in Guatemale from their roof; sipping a $1 beer watching Volcan Fuego erupt was a wonderful memory to take away.  Whilst there may be issue in the bathroom facilities, the staff were outstanding at all times and accommodating to the last. A great vibe running through the whole place.  I stayed twice in 2 rooms (volcano camp-out in the middle) and both were clean and tidy, offering a basic fan. Nothing else needed!  It is positioned just steps away from the central market with great street food options and is well known in the town for locals to take advantage of happy hour.', 'Stayed here in a dorm. Blonde lady on the desk was really friendly and helpful. Bar was fun and sociable and cheap. But rooms and bathrooms are really run down and quite dirty. Pretty noisy too. No kitchen either. Good location.', 'Antigua was basically our first stop in Guatamala and the hotel staff were very welcoming. The rooms were clean and comfortable (minus the pillows being a bit thin if I am being picky). The hotel felt very secure and the rooftop deck was awesome to read a book or play a game of cards. Plus, the included breakfast was an perfect start to the day (and a good way to practice Spanish as the breakfast staff did not speak English). ', 'Loved the character of this unique hotel! Accommodations in the center of town can become quite noisy at night so having to walk a few blocks towards the action in Antigua is a small price to pay for a peaceful nights sleep. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and breakfast in the morning was excellent.   The rooms are all a little different and the one me and my friend stayed in was really simple but all that we needed. The pillows on the bed were a little thin but the beds themselves were quite comfortable. I was amazed with how clean the rooms were given how old the hotel was.   The rooftop deck is a great place to catch the sun in the morning or have a beer at sunset. It would be nice if they had a few lounge chairs up there.   I would definitely stay here again and', \"I'm a little confused by the raving reviews. The hotel is overpriced for its location and level of service. It's a solid 15 minutes to the center of town and is located on the opposite side of most of the restaurants and amenities, meaning it's 20 minutes from things. In Antigua, this is quite a distance, as it's a really challenging city to get your bearings in. It's mostly a grid but very few streets are actually labeled/signed.  The breakfast was adequate at best. Not sure if the menu changed, but it's certainly nothing to look forward to. The free airport pick-up (a promotion mentioned on TripAdvisor) turned out not to be free, and when my flight time changed by 2 hours (which I communicated the day before arriving), I was left to get a cab at the airport.

Had all the typical amenities, safe, free water, flat screen tv, nice comfortable bed.  No hairdryers in the room so ask and they will bring it. The breakfast was good and the courtyard is beautiful and relaxing (so is the roof).  Would definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to anyone who wants to be in a great location in Antigua.  For the price I paid, I was very happy with the hotel. I do agree that Antigua is overpriced in general.', 'We stayed here for seven nights and had no complaints! Because of our schedule, most of the days we had breakfast and dinner here as well. A couple of our team members were diabetic and needed sugar free food. Each day the staff made sure to provide sugar free yogurts and sugar free drinks for them at each meal. You need to let them know the day before you will want whatever meal but they are very accomodating and we found the food delicious and very substantial!  Prices were of course more than you would spend at fast food (breakfast $5.50 American and lunch/dinner $8.00 American) for that you get a a full, hot meal with dessert too! With the added bonus of being able to relax in peace and quiet.  Our rooms were clean and beds were firm and comfortable. Staff was always cheeful', \"I stayed here recently and the property was clean and pleasant.  Rooms were ample and maintained very well.  Door lock on my room wiggled and didn't feel very secure, but the property is gated at night.  My main complaint was the advertised rate were listed in US dollars.  So I called, left my credit card and reserved a room.  When I arrived, they said they had already charged my credit card earlier in the week, but instead of charging me in US dollars, they charged me in Guatemalan Quetzales (no big surprise here), but the exchange rate was very high and above the market exchange rate.  Ended up costing me well over their listed rate once you converted back to US dollars on my credit card statement.  To me it's unethical to advertise in US dollars and use your own exchange\", 'This was my 3rd visit to this property and I\\'ve always loved it but this time was a bit less impressive.  We were there for a conference (which has been the case the other 2 times) but we came in early because the person I was with hadn\\'t been to Antigua before.  We booked the room with the \"hot tub on the terrace\" but there was a tiny terrace with a tiny table and chairs.  The hot tub was in a room within the room and it wasn\\'t a hot tub but a jetted bathtub (NOT the same thing).  Those of us who had booked this type of room wouldn\\'t use the jetted tub.  There used to be coffee in the rooms on my other visits but this time, there was just coffee in the hallways.  The place is still lovely but just not what it used to be.

The hotel is clean, the service is good, it has a good location, and if your Budget is limited, it´s almost cheap!', \"We stayed at the Santa Lucia No.3 in August, and had an upstairs room with balcony facing onto the street. The room was reasonable for the price, though a large damp patch on the wall could have done with being over-painted. I don't recall any problems with the beds.  I'd recommend the hotel, as it's an attractive place full of beams and olde world charm. However, you may wish to choose a different room. Whilst the balcony was nice there was a lot of noise from the street below - vehicles clattering along the cobbled street and drunks rolling home until the wee small hours - and the vent from the bathroom was linked to the adjoining rooms - so you could hear them going to the loo etc - not very pleasant!\", 'We stayed two nights in Casa Santa Lucia No. 3. It was recommended to us by a receptionist from the black cat inn that we stayed in before. Santa Lucia No3 is definitely an interesting place. It is a beautiful building and the rooms are nice. definitely something different. It is 10 minutes walk from the central plaza and probably 10/ 15 minutes walk from the bus station.   Previously we stayed in Black Cat inn and though we loved the location, the room was very dark and quite dull. Santa Lucia even though at the same price offers really lovely rooms and they are definitely worth a small walk. Also you skip the noise of all central hostels and guesthouses and it is nice and quiet.', 'Hotel with a good location, the service was great. The room was very comfortable with all the regular services, i asked for a room with AC. The staff works for the customers. Good restaurant, the breakfast is very complete, many local food. Totally recommended', 'Stayed here 2 nights.  The hotel was lovely, we were studying Spanish at a Spanish School in Antigua and this had some very quiet areas you could sit and study with a glass of vino.  All the staff were happy and kind, they were quiet happy to help us with our Spanish.   The room was very comfortable, the decor and beds were great.', 'Nice hotel located in a gated community app 15 minutes stroll from the centre of city. Large room with two large beds. Well equipped common room like a library. Walls etc is painted to give the illusion of an old building.

I think they've turned off the ability to upload, so don't plan on backing up photos, texting pictures, or posting online.   Otherwise awesome. \", \"The room felt fine but were the type of outdated where you couldn't tell if it was dirty or just old. They put us in a room by the maintenance area so we heard a lot of little noises. Plus, walls & doors were thin & let a lot of sound in. No windows, which I guess is normal for Antigua. Parking is down the street behind a gate at another hotel so it's not super convenient but fine. Receptionist was very friendly & we loved that our dogs were able to stay here. Great location. In the end, I expected a little more & we changed the next night to an airbnb place. \", \"Casa Rustica offerede several beautiful cortyards and terraces to relax in and enjoy beautiful views over Antigua and the volcanos nearby. Our room even had a door to the terrace. The hotel offerede free coffe and tea at all times and a kitchen available to cook whatever you liked.

Free coffee and water, strong WiFi.', \"Not only did this hotel offer an incredibly comfortable bed, excellent wifi, and a good hot shower, the staff were beyond helpful and accommodating (even giving us take-away breakfast at 4am for our trip to the airport), and the rooftop was gorgeous. Just be aware that the hotel is right next door a bar, so it can get a bit loud if you're trying to get an early night. It wasn't enough to deter me from staying there again.\", 'The courtyard, rooftop terrace, and rooms are beautiful, and the service was excellent. We had the continental breakfast on the roof with volcano views one morning, which consisted of coffee, juice, bread and fruit. Plentiful hot water and towel animals made our stay even more enjoyable. The only downside is that there is a bar next door and the music was loud around 9:30 pm when we went to sleep. Fortunately, we were very tired both nights from our full day of activities that we had no trouble falling asleep.', \"This small hotel is very conveniently located to the central square. Pros: Location, comfort (we had room #4, bed was very large and pillows were great), very helpful and nice staff. Cons: The hotel is actually next to a bar which got a bit loud at night, but with the fan on in the room we really couldn't hear the noise much. The rooftop seemed nice, but the added cost of the jacuzzi seemed unnecessary when  you are already paying top dollar for the hotel.   We left too early to have breakfast, so unfortunately can't rate that!\", \"Rooms are fine, a bit small and the beds are pretty uncomfortable and creaky.

While the staff were friendly, they mixed up our bus reservation twice, before telling us that there was no way for us to reach our next destination that day.

The decor, well... beauty lies in the eye of the beholder... it looks as if the owner went bulk shopping at Pier 1 Imports.

The front desk is attended 24 hours and I felt it was a safe place for both guests and any valuables.

However, since the reservation was made one day before my arrival the hotel charged me US$150.00 for one night (a night that I actually slept in the hotel under another reservation).

It is genuinely a nice place to grab a beer.  The rooms and the hostel itself, however, leave a lot to be desired. Some are nicer than others but it's in dire need of some tlc and a good scrub down.  On the upside they have the courtesy and foresight to close the bar around 10 so it doesn't disturb the hostel guests.  On the whole there's better value accomodation to be found in Antigua.

Also, they decided that the exchange rate between USD and Quetzals is higher than what it really is - unacceptable.

Disclaimers: I've spent over 2 years travelling, mostly in Latin America and am usually quite patient with price discrimination, but was frustrated with the multiple attempts at overcharging.\", 'I had the pasta of the day. My shrimp was cooked perfectly. The location was beautiful and they had classical music playing in the background. It was a fabulous meal with my friends. I would definitely come again.', 'Almost everything about our experience at this hotel was great!! All the staff was very friendly and attentive, and they allowed us to get one of our rooms right when we got to the hotel at 10am, even though the check in time was not until 3pm. The room was really nice, and they had the pool ready for us when we arrived (it is climatized which is great!). So our experience started perfectly until the moment we asked for some drinks and food from the pool. It took them about 25 minutes to bring us our drinks, which were not that good (we had some margaritas and mojitos). The food was very good, but it also took a long time. And this was not a one time thing, after that first order, it took them about 15 minutes to bring a glass of water and a glass of wine.   This is one of the', 'This hotel is located a good 20 minute walk from the city center (Parque Central). If you do not mind walking, this is the place to be. Secluded in a quiet neighborhood, this hotel offers colonial style architecture with a very unique open courtyard. Rooms are beautiful, comfortable and spacious. Breakfast is good (usually a choice of eggs, beans, baked banana and warm bread, but service may be slow and not always all options are available). Staff was very nice, but at times did not have all the training to fully assist guests. We had a wonderful time, but there are a few suggestions for improvement: (i) Shower could use less pressure (as the water is strong enough to hurt you), (ii) room key and safe key should not under no circumstance be on the same key ring (as they cannot', \"The nice was extremely quiet. It's a bit far from downtown Antigua, but the walk gives you a perfect opportunity for sightseeing. Breakfast is included although not a lot of options,  but delicious anyways. Staff is really friendly. I just didn't love the shower curtains were quite filthy. \", \"This hotel was our first on our trip to Guatemala and Chiapas. It didn't disappoint but it didn't fully live up to the standards we had hoped of it. The hotel was secluded and in a peaceful and secure area of Antigua, but it took at least 30 minutes walking to get to the downtown area (Parque Central). The room was spacious, as was the bathroom - although the bath was enclosed and felt very claustrophobic. As a previous reviewer wrote - there was no hair dryer - even though in the booking specifications it came with one!  The grounds and the views from the hotel were splendid although I personally would have enjoyed having a beer in the upstairs terrace - but that wasn't an option, as only water or juices were available.\", \"Beautiful hotel within perfect walking distance from the center of town. The staff is extremely friendly and the breakfasts are spot on. The only issue is that the hotel can get rather noisy if there is a group of 3 or more. The entire hotel/lobby captures noise and it reverberates it throughout every nook of the hotel. It really wasn't that big of a deal though. I'd definitely stay there again. \", \"We stayed at this hotel 3 nights.  It is located wonderfully on Antigua main square. The stuff very helpful and nice. very nice patio when you come in. We stayed in room number 3 a King bed room with no window just a glass door. The moment you come in the small of mold hits you. We put the fan to work but of course this doesn't help much. Also the room was not clean, well not sure when was last time they really washed the floors in our room, since we tried to clean a spot and got lots of black on the tissue. They provide just continental breakfast which means- bread, fruit and coffee/tea orange juice. Good quality internet.\", \"While this hotel is ranked high, my guess its due to its central location and overall very good service and nice staff. The problems are that the rooms are not ventilated well, of course no AC and the ventilator is ok, but not enough.  No parking near the hotel, you have to park the car about 700 meters away. Breakfast is weak, to say the least, it is fruits and bred, or waffles which weren't good.\", 'I enjoyed my visit to Anitgua and stay at Hotel Casa Rustica very much.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  The hotel was clean and offered all we needed to have a pleasant stay.  It is located conveniently and within walking distance to everything.', 'Lovely hotel. But you will not sleep one bit because of the nightclub next door.  Staff lied about the noise because they just want your money.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY GO TO A DIFFERENT HOTEL UNLESS YOU WANT TO PARTY.  I checked out the next day. I also think it’s strange when your staff keep walking around and turn off the public area lighting.  Looking forward a lame response from the management.  ', \"The hotel itself is in a great location, near a lot of attractions. I was disappointed that they fit three beds into a very tiny room meant for two beds.  The staff, however, is extremely helpful and accommodating to support your needs. The pricing is great compared to what Americans normally pay for hotels. I'd recommend it, but would shoot for a room with a private bathroom and more space. I'm also a dog lover, so being greeted by the two dogs was nice. The transportation to and from the airport is also helpful, as that can always be a pain for international travelers.   Side note: I did arrive the night before my reservation, and the man who works the night shift was extremely accommodating and let me get the room; this was at 12 a.m. by the way.\", 'We arrived with a reservation and were greeted friendly, and the clerk was multilingual. We requested a reservation change and were offered several options.  The clerk offered to let us look at several different rooms, and we chose the second one we looked at.

We enjoyed the stay and would return again.', 'We recently booked with Hotel Rustica through Booking.com. Our original email said we wanted a queen or double bed, but we didn\\'t want singles.

Clean, well priced and friendly. Unfortunately during my second stay the place was raided for drugs. This was a rouse it transpired and they came away empty handed. The owner, Braden (?), came round all guests and personally apologised which I really appreciated. He also explained that Antigua is no longer as safe for travellers as it once way and advised walking accompanied. Excellent service all round, dieter who I remembered from the zephyr lodge and the German girl at the desk, who's name escapes me (I'm sorry!). Anyway, despite what happened I would definitely go back and recommend to friends. It's not a party hostel but it's central\", 'This was my first time in Antigua and picking a hotel is never easy but this was defiantly a good choice. Although the hotel is on the edge of town and a little further from the central area, it meant it was a little quieter that other more central hotels. The room was a good size and the courtyard area very peaceful, staff were helpful and parking was free. A good breakfast was also included in the rate. One small issue was the sound from other rooms and from the courtyard. Due to the construction it was fairly noise in the room when people were entering and exiting the central area, especially when moving luggage in the stair well. Some guests also had loud conversations in public areas which could also be heard clearly in the room. Despite this, I would certainly return to', \"As one reviewer wrote-very inconspicuous on the outside. In fact if this is your first time coming here you might wonder if you're in the right place as it has no outwardly appearance of a hotel. As you walk through the small front door, you are instantly transported back in time. The hotel has beautiful wood work and the interior décor is rustic. Enjoy free breakfast daily in the dinning area. This hotel is small with two floors and less than 20 rooms if I remember correctly. I stayed in the Standard which had two queen beds and standard bathroom with a shower. The roof patio is calming and the views of the city and volcano are great. It's about a 20 minute walk to the main center of the town.  It felt safe with a small group to walk at night but use caution and stay in well\", \"It's still fairly inexpensive, but if you're willing to spend a little more in Antigua, this would be a good choice. The grounds and courtyard are really nice, and our room was very clean and comfortable. It's about a block off the main square, and located near restaurants and shopping. The front desk staff was very helpful and kind as well. Our double room had a flat screen tv and big shower with great water pressure. The wi-fi was a little spotty, but was fast when it worked. If you need transportation back to the airport, they can book it pretty cheap. The restaurant next door is excellent!\", 'I stay here twice a year. It is rustic and peaceful, a little primitive, but it has the vibe of Antigua. The staff is honest and friendly, the showers can be a little less than hot. The grounds are well maintained and are lovely.', 'Spent 3 nights here because it’s got a swimming pool. Rooms are a bit dingy & a little bit tired - synthetic sheets, but the grounds and the pool area are glorious. Breakfast is pretty good. I would stay again. The pool is next to a main road albeit behind a wall but there are noise & fumes as a result. In my view the air quality in Antigua is pretty poor overall though so there’s no escaping vehicle emissions wherever you stay, but I definitely recommend this place for the great grounds & pool & good breakfast', \"It has AMAZING facilities! It is a gorgeous-looking colonial hotel. So beautiful. Rooms a quite comfortable. It is what you expect it to be when you go to a colonial town like Antigua. Really nice areas. The bad thing is what the staff are making of it. They are lazy. In the reception, not friendly, generic. They didn't even smiled. Same at the restaurant. Which is a very strange area, by the way. Wi-Fi does not work in the rooms.  It was cheap though, so no major complaints. It's a shame though, as there is so much potential to be one the the top 3 hotels in town...  If I go again, I would unfortunately try somewhere else...\", 'Did not get to stay here. The hotel cancelled my room at the last minute and I had to scramble to find another. Since I had booked through a travel website, they even made me contact the travel website to get a refund. No help from this hotel, not a very nice experience. I do travel to Antigua often and will never book here. Poor customer service.', 'Before customer leaves, they go to count towels in the room, assuming they were stolen. I didn’t like they put in the bathroom a message to state that if the towels were “too dirty” they would put an extra charge. The pool was nice.

Nevertheless, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and kept the reservation. The grounds are beautiful and room has tasteful design, however the staff were not the most welcoming.  Upon check-in I was prompted to sign a blank form that had my CC # and no dollar/ quetzal value, in case there were any \"extra room charges\"... eek!

It is a good 4 block walk from Parque Central.  There is a nice little gym and lovely pool. The restaurant is very attractive but fairly pricey, and the food we had there wasn’t all that great.

No elevators as it is all one floor.It is comprised of two separate buildings joined by an underground tunnel. The rooms are nice with high ceilings and comfy. The windows are high set (at least in the room that we occupied) so it lets in light but you cannot see much outside. The restaurant is an open concept facing beautiful gardens', \"We stayed at La Casona de Antigua in August 2015. The hotel is a colonial property set in well maintained grounds. It's about a 15 minute walk from the centre and therefore fairly quiet. We would take the walk, even at night, and felt completely safe. However, the route isn't well lit by street lighting and often we wouldn't see many people while walking back at night. Therefore for solo travellers especially, it's probably sensible to take a taxi at night.  The rooms are a good size and similarly colonial in character. The bathroom was slightly small and the lighting could have been better (this was the case for the whole room). Unlike many showers we experienced in Central America, the shower had great pressure.  Breakfast was fair but with little choice as it's seemingly a\", 'We stayed 3 nights, the staff helped us book spa appointments and dinner reservations.  We thoroughly enjoyed the tasty breakfast on the roof terrace each morning, and indulged in the hot tub one night as well!  The hot tub was a real treat!  The location is very ideal, steps from the main square.  The only thing I was unhappy with was the amount of street noise into our room.  We were the first room nearest the street.  I think if you request a room toward the back, you will be just fine. ', \"Hotel D'Leyenda is a quaint little hotel in the heart of Antigua. It is so convenient to everything, within walking distance to all the sights in the city. It was very clean and nice, the staff was wonderfully helpful and gracious (and spoke a good bit of English). It includes a very nice breakfast which I ate on the beautiful rooftop terrace. I traveled alone and felt perfectly safe as well. They arranged my transport back and forth from the airport as well with no glitches. The only complaint I had was that it was a bit noisy from the bar next door - which of course they could not help. They provided a fan in my room and I just turned that on and all was well from then on. This is my second stay here and I enjoyed each one. Wonderful little jewel of a place!\", 'The hotel is very charming and would be perfect except for the fact that it is next door to several large and noisy bars.

The new owners of the bar/club next door keep the loud music and partying going to 2am and it is every night so far and we still have two more nights until we move. There is no refund once you have paid. Way to bad for the pleasant owners of this otherwise centrally located hotel that was really nice until this year. Hard to recommend. Definitely get an attached bath. Good for those who like to party late.', \"Rooms are comfortable and staff is freindly. We've stayed here two times and both times were enjoyable. Hotel is near to many cafes and resturants at walking distance. They have a nice rooftop balcony with beautiful views of Antigua. Chill around and lay on hammocks too.\", \"We stayed here for 13 nights and it was great! The staff and two dogs were friendly and welcoming. The roof top patio really make a long stay worth it, as the views are amazing and its a great spot for sun bathing. This hotel is central to everything else and its easy to pop in and out to drop stuff off or pick stuff up.  Though it is very loud during the night as there is a pub and nightclub next door. The hotel has no control over this but if you aren't someone who enjoys being out at those clubs and is trying to sleep, you might have better luck elsewhere.\", \"For the most part, everything was great. The kitchen was clean and organized, staff is very friendly, internet works great, and the location is close to everything. My only complaint is due to the nightclub next door. Every night it was loud, and difficult to get to sleep. It's unfortunate because it's not Casa Rustica's fault but it does make staying there tough if you're a light sleeper.

With its central location, just one block from the central park, its homely atmosphere, the friendly and helpful staff, its secure environment, the very clean room with private bathroom, TV and safe, I chose the same hotel  this year and was not disapointed. Behind the modest entrance there is a reception, a lobby with computers and coffee tables, two inner gardens with trees, plants and flowers, furnished rooftop terraces with a view of the beautiful city and the surrounding mountains and access to a kitchen.

The check in was easy, staff was nice, locked door to get into compound. The room was nice and bed comfortable. No air condition, which is normal for the area. The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because there are no bars on room window facing courtyard. Leaving your window open at night for air flow gave a bit of unease.

Cons: small cramped rooms, too few toilets, a bit dirty, really loud at night.  I stayed here with friends, it was highly recommended by a fellow traveler so we gave it a try. The bar up top is really fun and the staff working the bar are super friendly. However because it is a party hostel there are some downsides. Stayed 3 nights and twice I woke up to puke on the floor-one I heard happen, someone vomited right beside our window as they were leaving around 11pm.

It generally exudes a nice, calm, peaceful atmosphere.  However... While the hotel itself is quiet and relaxing, you can't say the same for the neighbours.  Yes, the location is slightly out of the central part of town, but the property backs on to a very major road. Trucks, motorcycles, chicken buses, and more can be heard all hours of day and night.  Depending on the side of the hotel that your room faces, this may be more or less of an issue.  The pool and restaurant are on the side closest to the busy road, so you won't necessarily have a relaxing resort-like time sitting\", 'Clean rooms, but simple and classic.  Beautiful grounds and gardens, so lovely!  Nice clean pools, the juccuzzi was cold though.  The restaurant is open until 4pm and not a huge selection, I recommend the nachos mixtos.

Then, the manager tried to tell us that breakfast was not included when indeed, we had booked a room that included breakfast.

Our room was Las Rosas and it was the only room on our trip that had air-conditioning and a mini-bar/fridge.   Although the air-conditioner was too noisy to use at night, it cooled the room down sufficiently so that we were able to sleep comfortably.     The room also had a safe; a desk; two complimentary bottles of water which were replaced daily; and a private out-door court-yard with a table and chairs.   This was in a shaded location and was much appreciated.     The hotel itself is lovely with inner court-yards, and a beautiful pool area and gardens (you can find this by going through the restaurant.)  Breakfast was a delightful surprise.  It was a traditional breakfast of fruit; eggs; plantains;', \"First the positives: I loved the atmosphere at this hostel. it's a party hostel but not as loud as the others. It actually has a somewhat laid back vibe. The staff were awesome. Everyone was cheerful and incredibly helpful-- from those manning the front desk, to the bar tenders, to the ladies cleaning the rooms. it was easy to book tours and shuttles, and they do offer their own Acatenango hike which makes it convenient if you're planning to do that. Those triple decker bunk beds do look daunting, and i'd imagine there would be safety concerns if one attempts to get on the topmost bunk in a drunken state, but i've witnessed nothing of that sort when i stayed there. I didn't really mind it since i eventually got used to it, plus the beds were incredibly comfy--- made it worth the\", \"The initial welcome at reception was positive and the lady was really helpful. However, we found that was the best thing about our stay at Tropicana. The bar staff were rude and misogynistic, very 'American spring break'.  Regarding the sleeping conditions, the beds did have individual curtains you could pull, but were also three story high bunk beds. Unluckily, I was on the third floor. This meant that just climbing up to my bed was a bit of a scary workout. It would have been fine, but the room was just so loud. The hostel advertises quiet time from 10pm - 9am, but I managed approx 1h sleep. I was kept awake at night, largely due to the hostel staff arguing and breaking the glass in windows, and then woken up by loud chatter at 7am the next morning. Overall impressed. \", \"Reading all the reviews I had to check myself when I first arrived that this was the right 'place to stay'. Whilst I can't really comment on the friendliness of the staff particularly (for me - one night, and I was outta there) in terms of the actual accommodation itself, I'm not sure how you could ever give this place 4 or 5 stars?  Whilst it might have been acceptable 15-20 years ago, I think travellers expectations (even budget travellers) on what constitutes a decent bed & cleanliness is more than what this place delivers. Surely gone are the days of straw mattresses (obviously, they did not have straw mattresses!) and lumpy pillows with superman pillow cases (although that wouldn't surprise me), I'd much rather pay $1 or $2 extra a night for this to be put towards updating\", \"The owners are so welcoming and go above and beyond for you.

Beautiful hotel and grounds (main building is an old monastery, surrounding grounds are ruins — the crypt is very cool) with several museums on-property.  Guests get to tour the museums for free, where as day visitors have to pay roughly $20/person.  You don’t have to be a guest to roam the gardens and regular grounds (free to public).  For the 6 museums, it’s roughly $20/person for the ‘all-museum’ package for day visitors (free if you’re a hotel guest).  I think it would be better to just be a day visitor and stay at a cheaper hostal or VRBO in town (the hotel is a little bit of a walk to the east of town on Calle 3).', 'I was seduced by the pictures of the pool when booking Hotel Porta. Truth to be told it is lovely to stay around the pool and read or relax after exploring Antigua. Having said that, Porta is a huge hotel consisting of several buildings. During the weekend it is a wedding destination and it is packed and very noisy. Furthermore the rooms are not insulated  and you need to hope that your neighbours are quiet, ours were not and no matter how much we complained to the front desk, nothing stopped the partying in the room next door late at night. Should you nevertheless stay, ensure that your room is located on the inside row in the courtyard. Rooms facing the outer wall will be plagued by the noise of passing cars on the cobbled street.

They also have a great rooftop terrace with an awesome happy hour and stiff drinks. I would stay here again.  There were definitely some noisy aspects until about 11pm on a couple of nights because of the party scene. The people in there 50s in the room next to us were clearly dying to get out of there.

They also had really amazing drink specials from 11 am to 8 pm every day where you could get a selection from three different beers and two liquor drinks for only 10Q a piece!

On the departure day we found out that the bus had already left one day earlier and that there must have been a communication problem between the reception lady and us. The hostel let us spend one night for free and gave us the possibility to explain our problem to the hostel's owner on the next morning. He was really helpfull and understanding.

The rooms are very basic, have a bed and a fan. The sheets are clean include linen and a pillow as well as a towel.  We shared a double room and there was plenty of space and had an amazing view of the local volcano.

Additionally, and with the exception of the nasty Casa Santo Domingo, virtually everyone in Antigua strives to make visitors happy with over the top service. This alone makes it hard to criticize Antigua hotels largely because you don't want an unjaundiced review to reflect badly on waiters, hotel staff and others who have worked hard to make your stay enjoyable.

It is on a corner with two large windows facing into the hotel hallway, and as a result was noisy and people could see into our room if we didn't close the curtains. Other than that it was comfortable. Room 2 was much better, with more privacy and a very nice tiled shower.

The service in the breakfast area was pleasant and efficient, and we felt more at home than in a hotel. Where this hotel comes up short, however, is in the ventilation. The room had no AC, which is not a problem in Antigua. However, it also had no ceiling fan, no screens on the windows, and not even a floor fan that could be borrowed.

The hotel is located a couple of blocks away from the Central Park, and it is walking distance to many of the attractions and sights in the city.  The room itself was spotless, with two things that do not let this be a 5 star review.  One, the temperature in the room depends on a small fan.  And two, the beds are not the most comfortable.  Other than these two nuisances, the hotel is a great alternative when visiting Antigua.', \"We spent one night at this hotel and were very pleased with our visit. The rooms were clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, the location is great! It is not a 5 star boutique hotel but it's also a 400 year old building.

The hotel is a 20-min walk to to centre of Antigua which is quite awkward. On the plus side, the staff are very helpful and warm and friendly. The courtyard is really pretty. The coffee is really nice. The rooms are done in a colonial style but our room smelled of damp masked by too much wood polish. Breakfast was spartan - there is no buffet and the servings are small.', \"The price is reasonable and the owners were friendly enough, but definitely lacking a woman's touch. The place is near the bus terminal and all day long you could hear the activity going on. It's also not a safe area of Antigua. I was able to confirm this by talking to some locals. Maybe that's why you have to ring the bell everytime to get into the hostel, instead of many hostels that are only locked at night. The place could have been cleaner, more organized, etc. The place was lacking decor, needs updating, new pillows, etc.  Breakfast was supposed to be at 8:30 but was late both days I stayed there.

Inter courtyard windows open but then no privacy.  Place had hot water at times but not enough to handle group of 13 taking showers at the same time.

One block from Parque Central and everything else in Antigua.  Small room but it's nice and friendly stuff. Could be noisy on the week but anywhere in Antigua is noisy.

My friend and I were coming home from dinner and we were a half a block away and 4 men came around the corner in a car and jumped both of us.  They took everything we had.  We had specifically asked the front desk person if he thought it was ok to walk to the restaurant.  He said that it would be fine that it was a totally safe place.  He should not give advice like that to two women after dark.  He should have suggested a cab.  We had planned to stay two nights but after the trauma, we had to return to Guatemala City and get new passports.

(Happy hour til 8 is advertised, but they charged me the discounted price every time.)   The dorms are small and sparse, but the beds are comfy. Plugs are very limited, and I thought it was a little awkward that the wall plug was basically in the bottom bunk. Made charging things a little awkward.   I was concerned about there only being two showers and three toilets for the whole hostel, but it actually wasn't ever an issue while I was there. May be at other times though?   Lonely Planet (2013) says breakfast is included, and it is not. I wouldn't bother with it as there are much better places for food in town. Wifi\", 'This was a nice choice. The room was beautiful and the bed super comfortable. Everything was close and convenient and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was the reason they lost a star.

The hostel is a short distance walk from the centre of Antigua but also has restaurants and bars nearby (in,curing the next door ale house). The dorms are big but I liked how each bed had an allocated storage space and curtains plus our own sockets and bed light! There are plenty of showers and toilets but a few only had cold water (the ones in the middle seemed to work best) The doors are locked at night which is nice for security. Overall, a pretty decent cheap place to stay!', 'This hostel is in a great location and has a cool vibe. Dorms have their own charging point,  light and privacy curtain which I liked. Cool common areas. The only downside is that the hot water in the showers was very patchy which is why I would stay elsewhere next time im in Antigua.', \"In my opinion doesn't deserve the excellent score it gets on here. Because of circumstances ended up staying in both the privates and dorms. Why not? First of all, the privates were SUPER noisy, you could hear people in the room next to you zip their bag open... Then, when I tried to hang up my clothes, the whole clothes hanger fell of the wall. In the dorms the locker door broke when opening it. Because the 'lockers' are made out of plywood, just pushing against the lock is enough to get the screw out. So, don't expect your valuables to be safe. The hostel offers no breakfast service, doesn't have a laundry service and doesn't allow drinks from outside to brought in. A positive point: most of the staff I dealt with was nice! Location is good.\", 'We started our Guatemala travels at the Big Foot hostel. The staff, especially Yanira, is extremely friendly and helpful.

Set a fair walk (about 15 minutes of cobbled road)  from the main square but not too far to walk off dinner. The rooms are clean, although not a lot of natural light.

This property is in a gated community so can be a little tricky to find.\", \"This hotel has spacious rooms with high ceilings and chandeliers, and the hotel is in a good location. The staff are friendly and helpful. However this hotel was much more expensive than nicer hotels in the same neighborhood. I paid $150 (including taxes) for one night here, but only $80 across the street at Meson de Maria the preceding nights. In this hotel, the bathrooms are outdated, the noise from the neighborhood is easily heard in the rooms on the weekend, and overall the property is quite average. I wouldn't pay the same price to stay here again, but perhaps the price was higher for the festival weekend.\", \"This is a very basic, but clean hotel.  The courtyard is filled with beautiful, lush flowers and greenery. The buffet breakfast in the morning is fine. The staff is very nice and helpful.

You can't beat the value at this hotel!

I hike/trek a lot, and I've been in a number of hiking trips over the years. This was one of the worst. Here are the reasons from my perspective :  1. The group was ridiculously big and they didn't split the groups : 17 people signed up for the 2 day trip. Normally, outdoor trip groups shouldn't be more than 10 because it becomes really hard to manage all these people, especially for the not so easy trip like Volcan Acatenango.   You simply can't expect all 17 people to go at a similar pace - there would be people who go fast and slow. You have to split the groups into at least 3.

At some point on our final day we asked why the water in our shower was tepid / cold and we were told that we had to request the staff to turn on the immersion heater in order to have hot water. I find it really shocking that we were never told this obvious fact on arrival. For the amount you pay (which is towards the top rate in town for the rooms with jacuzzi...which we never got to use due to the lack of hot water and the fact we would have had to wait about 5 hours for it to fill up due to lack of pressure) we would expect a certain level of service. Instead, we weren't told about the hot water, the rooms were not equipped with fans and this meant that we had to open the windows to let the\", \"I booked this hotel for me and boyfriend to stay in for a few days on arriving in Guatemala. Sadly they did not confirm my booking properly and had my name down wrong so it was a massive hassle to check in after a 19 hour trip. The hotel is priced in the higher bracket yet didn't appear to have any fans, air conditioning or screens on the windows. this meant that we couldn't open the windows to ventilate in the heat because of the mosquitos and as a result the room was very humid and hot. strange for a country that has plenty of mosquitos and a hot humid climate. the showers were cold and the jacuzzi in our room was also ice cold and took 20 minutes to run about an inch so we gave up. the beds are not comfortable and have springs poking into your back. the hotel reception didn't\", 'Stayed at Posada La Merced as part of a GAdventures tour.  The receptionist was very helpful the day previous to the tour and booked our transport to the Pacaya Volacano and recommended some really nice restaurants for us for our dinner!

The biggest highlight was the friendliness of the front desk staff.', 'Great service, hotel rooms are super cute and comfy.

Which can get quite annoying if you come home late (try getting a taxi or a tuk-tuk in Antigua at night...) or want to return once or twice during the day.  The advantage is that it is really quiet.  The boys at the reception really try to do everything for you and are very knowledgeable when it comes to Antigua. The chef is happy to fulfil any of your wishes for breakfast. If you need something ironed, washed, fixed, order a taxi, they do it for you. Short: Superb service.

The staff was very  friendly, attentive and available 24/7 which made for a very personable experience.  Centrally located the hotel is secured and accessible to guests only and requires that the staff unlock the wrought iron gate for any type of access, which we felt was appropriate for this type of property.  Definitely a place to recommend.', 'We really liked Mil Flores, but would have chosen a large room, we were in the smallest and it was definitely a little cramped and a little musty smelling but the bed was comfortable enough.  The staff was really the star of the experience though, and was always there to offer help and assistance when needed.', 'We just spent a weekend in Antigua and we felt very much at home in this small but very cosy hotel. The staff was attentive and very kind, the rooms are furnished with a lot of taste, balancing the history of Antigua with a touch of cool and modern design. The patio, with the pool and the beautiful garden is certainly a wonderful feature of this hotel. The hotel only offers breakfast.

The Junior Suite (Room 110) faces the street, next to the hotel there is a mechanics shop, hence noise. In general avoid room 110 as it is next to the breakfast area.  Not a good hotel to sleep.

Located just behind the market and only 10 minutes walk from the central park in a safe and friendly barrio, I would recommend this place to all. Soñia and Antonia were so very lovely and friendly and went kurt of their way to make me feel at home.

Often run my Aussies (me being Kiwi) I have my personal opinions but generally a lot of fun. The party vacates at 10 so even if you are tired you'll probably still get to sleep at a reasonable hour. Beds are cleaned daily and the pool is always a nice cool temp. I'd stay again without qualms just carefully getting off the top bunk when needing a drink in the night!\", \"As it states this is a party hostel so don't  expect it to be quiet but we still managed to have a few quiet nights of pretty much undisturbed sleep.

I throughly enjoyed my stay here, it has a good mix of social events, adventure activities and information. The pricing of the hostel and it's food is fair based on prices throughout Antigua (one of the most expensive place in Guatemala) and the happy-hours and location are perfect. My experience with the volunteers and staff was great, they were very attentive and polite people. I had my first try in a beer pong tournament here and totally enjoyed it,\", \"Really social fun hostel with stuff on every evening. Food is good here with generous potions. Bathrooms and dorms clean. 3 tier bunk beds (try get in early to get a bottom bunk!) we were probably lucky with our dorm but it's right by the pool and had around 15 people in it so if you need sleep maybe ask for a dorm out the back! \", \"cute hotel. felt very safe. employees were friendly. filtered after to refill bottles was great to have! let the shower run for a bit, it's very cold to start. and shower at not peak shower times. near lots of great restaurants!\", 'A great little hotel to stay in. Booked the \"family suite\" that came with two rooms and 4 beds. Great customer service and a very helpful staff. It is a smaller hotel with a small courtyard. The courtyard makes it a little loud but that is to be expected. Good location as everything is walk-able in the old part of Antigua and I do mean mean you will be doing a lot of walking.

Our group of 9 was on main floor and we never found it to be noisy (though a couple of our people were asked to quiet it down late one night on the roof !}  Americans of various ages were there.

The place was nice enough, with spacious rooms and hot showers.  We brought with us a few card games and enjoyed playing them in the courtyard with a few beers late night.  What made this hotel so exceptional, was the night desk man, Jonathan.  He was not only professional and extremely friendly, he was knowledgable about the history of the hotel as well as Guatemalan politics and economics.  He made our stay at Hotel Casa Antigua extremely memorable.', \"We arrived at noon.  Even when we knew that check-in were at 3:00 p.m., there was a bunch of rooms available.  Notwithstanding, the clerk asked us to go and came back at 3:00 to take the room.  So we did. At 3:00 p.m. we were given the room 205.   Upper floor, as we've asked for.  It was awful.  The room was uncleaned, the bed bad dressed, dark, the flush didn't work, and for taking a shower we should run the water for 20 minutes to get it warm!!!  And we were paying U$S 125,00 per night that is not that cheap... We took our time to glance around, and we saw many, many free rooms, all of them nicer than ours.

On Sunday, the restaurant was closed so no breakfast. They deliver cold breakfast at night, but there was no bottled water supplied so could not make coffee in the room.

My first steps in to the courtyard I could tell it wasn't quite Panza Verde level, but once we got to our dirty, dark and dank smelling room I was super upset, as this hotel was only $15 or so dollars less than Panza and not even on the same level at all. I immediately asked for a room switch or refund (planning to call Panza for a last minute booking upon refund) and the front desk lady said there were no extra rooms and also no refunds.

The smallish standard rooms are fine and include a decent breakfast,  but for a little extra you can upgrade. There are flat-screen TV's with BBC and CNN. Furnishings are in character with the building and include some nice antiques.  There is a small lounge area on the ground floor with comfortable seating.\", \"The hotel is safe, clean and has friendly service. It's a little far from the downtown, but this facilitated a quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Hotel is close to laundry facilities and convenience stores.

I took a private room and there wasnt anything special but it was clean and the bed was comfy! The dorms looked clean also (i just took a look) didnt stay there! The best spot at that hostel is on the 2nd floor where 1hamack is, the view is beautiful and the wifi is good there lol! I think the prices were reasonable for what you get!

The rooms were clean and adequately equipped.  They offered 3 options for a freshly prepared breakfast each day which provided a tasteful variety. The rooms are not climate controlled but they offered us a fan for our room which made the room comfortable.  Although the rooms are not equipped with hair dryers the supplied one when we requested it.  The personnel were friendly and helpful throughout the visit.  Their concern put this place over the top.  I recommend this to those who do not demand all the amenities offered at higher priced hotels but want a clean, quiet and personal place to rest.\", 'We had a nice stay here while in Antigua for 3 nights. The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was big, clean and homely (and had a huge bed) and we had breakfast one morning with juice which was very good as well.

There is a courtyard with a little fountain in the center of the hotel where you can sit and sip a cup of coffee. Interesting decor throughout the common areas. We enjoyed a choice of breakfast entrees on the roof deck, which had a beautiful view of the city.  Staff is very attentive.  The rooms are very basic but also clean.  Bathrooms are tiny.  Remember, you are staying in a colonial city where many buildings are very old.  If I could do it again, I’d request a second floor room.  You’ll need to keep the windows open and on the first floor, that meant hearing the comings and goings of guests walking through the courtyard.  Also try to avoid the room nearest the kitchen.

Pleasant and helpful staff who all seem to speak English very well, a great location one block away from La Merced, and fabulous comfy beds all conspire to make this place worth returning to in my opinion.  Although it can get a little noisy due to the design of hacienda type buildings, the staff do their best to try to house the tour groups in a different area of the hotel.  There are two outdoor seating areas with views, one facing La Merced and one on the very top of the building with lots of seating and a 360 degree view.

We got there on a late evening, super tired, and... The reception man was questioning if I have a reservation there cause he couldn't find us!!!! The 2 rooms were one at the second floor and one at the third floor!!  First time, none of us could get any sleep because of the noise from the other rooms.

Casa couldn't be in a better location, it is both safe and convenient to get to all attractions day and night. It had a cool colonial setting, provided good, free coffee and was clean. I would like to write more positives but as you might have picked up in the slightly sarcastic overview we had several frustrating issues.  You need to be aware that an extra 28% will be added in this hotel as with some others in Guatemala, this might be more of a booking.com issue that this was not clear but it\", 'Chosen for its location, we were happy with where this little hotel was two blocks from the central plaza but during the night there were noises.

Accommodating staff, and cozy rooms, each unique, in this retrofitted colonial mansion. Very fast wifi--surprisingly so for Guatemala.', 'It seems contradictory, but let me explain.  The hotel offers minimum accommodation: mattresses (a little bit old); small bathroom (at least mine was), room not spacious enough.  The arrangement is typical from a Colonial House, all rooms open to the patio/garden (be careful to leave open food, cockroaches and ants will come in for a visit). Breakfast has to be ordered the day before (time and choice of food, not very convenient if you are on holidays), except for the buffet day. I only had breakfast one day, buffet day, choice was limited and not very good.  I must say that pancakes were good. The price of the hotel is very expensive, a similar hotel not in Antigua would be one third of the cost of this hotel.  Antigua is very expensive for Hotels. I was invited to give a talk', 'This is not your typical hotel with hairdryers and irons. Instead, it is gorgeous rustic living among beautiful gardens and the spirit of Guatemala. A wonderful retreat from big city American living. The staff was very friendly and helpful even though I did not speak Spanish. I felt safe and well attended to during my stay.

Be sure to take a tuk tuk or a cab back after dark! The one major downside to this hotel is its location, It is a good 10min walk to the square, the good part was that we found a great little wine bar about halfway, it only has seating for about 5 couples but very charming and quite intimate and cozy. you can't miss it if you walk.\", 'The rooms, the staff, and the FOOD were on point , i recommande this hostel for anyone that want’s to enjoy the beautiful City of Antigua and want a Nice and welcoming place to stay and it offers many shuttles!', \"The D'Leyenda Hotel is one of the best hotels in Antigua - and the best hotel of our Guatemala/Belize trip.

The beds and baths are adequate though I wish they'd put additional blankets on the bed when the weather turns cooler. That said, we arrived on a Saturday night and the noise level coming from the bar/establishment next door, was incredible! Fortunately, my kids and I are very sound sleepers and we were exhausted so we managed, after sometime, to get to sleep. The situation was identical on Sunday night. It wasn't until Monday that it quieted down.  The hotel charges more on the weekend because of the increase in demand from the city. I suggest they offer a discount instead. The noise level is really a disservice to its guests.\", \"I stayed here the first and last night of a work trip before heading to our partner community in Xela.

There was an ok amount of space, although there was nowhere to put luggage (our bags either blocked the door to the courtyard or to the bathroom hallway). I couldn't get the door to the hallway (to the shared toilet) locked/unlocked, so it was annoying to get up to use the toilet in the middle of the night. The bed was pretty comfortable.

In fact, I would say that Antigua is a good place for visiting, exploring the landscape, but not necessarily for staying in a lovely charming hotel (i.e, most of them are overpriced for what they offer).

It's outside the center, and quite dodgy to walk on its street after dark. They might have spent a bit more to make the room comfortable, than to desperately try to make it stylish. The fake antique is a bit tasteless. It was weird that we could not find a single person in a hotel in such a turistique town, who could speak an other language than Spanish.  In general OK, don't believe the rubbish about the safety locker, the hair\", 'This is a small hotel. We liked it when we got there but when we saw the room it wasn’t what we expected.  When we asked if we could change it, they just say no. We were there in high season so; we couldn’t find something else in another hotel so we decide to stayed there.  We wait a little bit till they clean our room but it has no towels, so we called 2 times to front desk asking for those. 15 minutes later finally towels. Next day we are at the Volcano, when we came back at night they didn’t make the room but they took the towels we had. So, I had to call 3 times again asking for towels, 30 minutes later my boyfriend decide to go to front desk to see what was happening and he found the front desk guy watching TV with the guard, so that’s what the reason why they never took', 'Casa Antigua was a great choice while visiting Antigua.

The other travelers were all good people.  And the location by the market makes it easy to explore the wonderfl labrynth of local food stalls and then cook them up in the hostel kitchen.  I will definately  stay there when I pass through Antigua again!', \"I stayed four nights with Raul and Fernando, which turned out to be great hosts as mentioned in other reviews.  Things here are basic, but for the cheap price (Antigua is an expensive place) of 50Q with breakfast it's great value! Location is good, next to the market and 3 blocks from the park, it's clean , and has a decent communal kitchen. The beds are not the best but you will get a good night sleep as the area is very quiet.  But the most important - you stay and support with local Guatemalan people, which for me is always a big advantage over American/European owned places.

Be very careful when reserving, even mistakes that aren't your fault will cost money. They are not customer oriented. I have repeatedly emailed after seeing charges on my card, they say it doesn't matter if it was a mistake and the charges will not be reversed. It seemed like a nice hotel staff, but once money got involved, they were not very friendly. This was my first trip and I will not be making reservations with them. There are much nicer places with awards just a few blocks over and half the price.\", \"Good location in the heart of the action in Antigua, Guatemala. Bed was comfortable, and never had to wait for the clean shared bathroom. Not a party hostel but not a retirement home either. Close to several bars and nightclubs which can get loud at night. Front staff could have been better with English and overall friendliness. They sell beer and bottled water in house. Offered free filtered water in the lobby but I didn't drink it after I saw their filter. Shared baths were good. Shared kitchen was primitive but functional. Free use of the communal fridge was nice.

Was not informed that there was a nightclub next door, and that the sound carried through the entire building. Considering the price, having a shared bathroom and being forced to listen to the club is ridiculous.', \"I stayed here after a month of staying in other hostels. It was a nice change and comfortable stay. Hot water!!! I enjoyed swimming at their sister hotel's pool and the views of Antigua from the roof were relaxing and pretty. The staff was friendly and accommodating. They allowed me to store my luggage while I took a day trip elsewhere. That's customer service!  It does get noisy at night because of the other bars around.

Highly recommended :-)\", \"I stayed at the Casona for three nights while on a trip with Overseas Adventure Travel (OAT). IT is in a residential neighborhood, about a ten minute walk to the city center. I felt safe walking solo or with a buddy in the area.

The beds are comfy, each room has a TV, soaring ceilings, and a gorgeous bathroom that resembles limestone.  They offer a full breakfast each morning, but it is al fresco, so if you get cold easily, you may not find this comfortable.

Clean but not much bigger than the bed. No AC but roof fan. The room got quite warm and a bit humid (rainy season). There was a heavy rain and the bath room roof leaked slightly. TV and Wi-Fi. What increases my rating is the lovely roof terrace and nice staff. They don't run a restaurant but they do serve a nice breakfast and there are several restaurants nearby.

Initially it seemed fairly nice but on walking to the main area we found the bar crowded and roaring techno music.  Our room was situated right opposite the bar so there was no chance of getting a good night's sleep after our long journey.

However our room was near the bar area making it very loud with music until 11pm and people passing throughout the night. Our bed sheets were visibly stained and unchanged. They provided clean sheets when we asked but no real apology.   If you are not in Antigua to party then I would not recommend staying here as you will be kept up late by people returning from clubs and woken early by the music which the bar starts playing from 7:30am.

For $12 for a double room and free breakfast, it sure is great value. The common area/patio outside is a great place to chill. The bonus of this hostel is that it is close to the main square of town and most importantly the Mercado where you can buy the freshest and cheapest fruit and vegetables.

It cost us about 13 CND each to share a room and felt it was worth the money. It was clean, had friendly staff and was in an excellent location- about 5 minutes from the centre. The terrace was also quite nice. Despite the name, I would definitely say it is a hostel, not a hotel.

What i didnt like about it was that we paid $57 for one of the tiniest rooms we have ever stayed in. Once we dumped our luggage, there was no more floor space.

The room was impeccably clean and comfortable and the hotel itself was very nice.  The staff was helpful and pleasant.  Unfortunately there is a club or bar next door with music and a DJ that literally shake the windows until about 1am.  At least their music selection was decent, but if what you want is to sleep, you might want to look elsewhere.', 'Basic rooms. Asked the maid to use unscented products and she obliged. Everyone there was very helpful and professional. The bar next door is noisy some nights, but we managed to sleep through it. The location was great. It made us feel safer walking home at night because it was so central and busy. Need to update the sheets. Clean, but stained and tattered.', \"To start with something fairly positive, this is an average hotel with clean rooms. However, there are some negative points I have to stress out. First of all, it is next to a disco which has loud music during the night. You can literally hear the people sing along. Secondly our true bad experience began when the power went off in the outside building right before I wanted to go to bed. Since I was showering I was waiting for it to get on again. After ten minutes I walked downstairs to the concierge who didn't even noticed yet the power was off. The concierge tried to fix it but didn't succeed. Since my girlfriend was already in bed (we had to get up at 4 in the morning for a transfer to Guatemala City) switching rooms was no option. When I told the concierge that we had a\", 'being over priced i expected a little more than a cramped room and a cheap uncomfortable bed. the staff are not helpful and the owner showed a general lack of interest in talking to clients.....keep looking there are much better places for better prices', 'The hotel is a more rustic building with a nice courtyard. Do not expect modern plumbing but it all works well enough. The location is excellent with only a block away from the Central Park or from the Arc. Hotel is quiet, with no street noise audible inside. The enjoyment of the hotel depends a bit on the room you get. Room 21 is not good, as it does have a room above it and insulation is typical of old buildings: there is none. So we were treated on walking and moving furniture noises by the guests upstairs at 2:15 am.  After a trip to Lake Atitlan we returned for one more night and had a better experience with room 8 although two men thought that having a discussion in the little courtyard in front of our room at 6:15 am was a good idea.

To be honest there are lots of good choices in Antigua but I found this one to be excellent.', \"Double Room was 10 US at the phone, seemed like people payed way less when bargaining in person. Room looked absolutely awful, pretty much the worst i've seen in central America. On the bright side, the owner seemed extremely nice and helpful.

The staff was so great, I'm still friends with a few of them! The hostel itself is awesome - the terrace on the roof, the pool (which is freezing, but refreshing!), the chill out/movie room, and the hammocks in the back are what make it! No matter whether you want to party or not, you're good to go. I also loved that the bar closed at 10, that way the staff could come out on the town with us or if we want to go to sleep earlier we were able to!   I only had two complaints - the triple level bunks and the New Years dinner. Getting to the very highest bunk is a struggle! And the BBQ on New Years was a pretty big disappointment; while the salads and sides were all really good, my meat was undercooked. I had to return the meat 3 times before I finally\", \"Best hostel in Antigua by a country mile!! Great staff everyone including the owners are on a level, really cool party vibe with the Pool and rooftop bar, a Cheeky G'n'T in the hot tub is a must!

On arrival we retrieved our luggage that had been delivered there from the secure room, all had been well looked after. We dropped our bags in our room and went straight up to the roof terrace where there was a great view of the volcano erupting, a beautiful sight at night.  The room was kind of small but adequate for one night. I might have been a little uncomfortable for any longer.

The breakfast was nicely prepared w/ fresh OJ, eggs, fruit bread delicious local coffee. Several options are offered and were all nice hearty breakfasts to start a day of exploring or simply walking the streets of this beautiful former capital city. The rooftop terrace is an added plus allowing a full view of the Agua Volcano or star gazing at night. ', 'The Porta was our home base in Guatemala for a week.    Nice, well appointed room.  Water filter in room is a plus.  Our room had a fireplace as well as a patio.  The breakfast buffet is top notch with omelette bar, waffles, fresh juices, and lots of other breakfast foods.  They have lots of conference rooms.  We were with a large group and everyone we talked with had a good experience at the Porta.', 'Stopped here for a buffet lunch during a day tour of Antigua.

We've been to Antigua many times before and normally stay at other hotels we are familiar with. This time we chose Camellias as the hotel we wanted was under construction for remodeling.  I do not recommend staying here as the bathroom was very outdated and smelled like a men's bathroom as they use urinal cakes hanging off of the toilet for a deodorizer.  You will have a hard time getting a good night's sleep as you can hear everybody arriving and leaving in the evening and mornings.

This hotel is run by Don Ismael as the name says and other members of the family. The family is very nice and friendly, although only in Spanish (but hey we are in Guatemala, deal with it :-)) Admittedly, the rooms are not very big and natural light is relatively scarce, but it is quiet and for Antigua good value at 250Q a night including breakfast for 2 persons. Talking about breakfast, you have the choice between pancakes with fruit or the more traditional beans with rice. I can only talk for the pancakes, which were delicious. Additionally, coffee or tea is included. Taking into consideration that such a breakfast normally sets you', \"I've stayed at Hotel Las Camelias three times and had a very good experience each time.  The outdoor space, in particular is really beautiful.  It has a central courtyard garden surrounded by seating and then a roof deck where you can see volcanoes in the distance (the last two times I was there El Fuego was shooting off smoke and small amounts of lava).  The staff is friendly, the hotel is kept very clean, and the breakfast was good as well.  My only complaint is that, because of the humidity of Antigua and the lack of ventilation in the bathrooms, almost every bathroom has a lot of mold in it...which is not great for allergy sufferers such as myself.\", 'Altough the hotel looks very nice, we had a very wet room, you could smell it all the time and it might be hard for someone to sleep in such room. On the other hand, the room was clean and the receptionist spoke good english and were willing to help. Water and coffee is free all day long.', \"The Inn comfort and quality is relative to the area. There are no luxury hotels in Antigua. The location is excellent to all Antigua areas, the Plaza, the Santo Domingo, Tours, etc. Is a lively place, with nice interior patio and lobby, you'll hear noise from other rooms and the lobby. The service is helpful and exceptional. They really know hospitality. We lost our flight and they gave us the extra days at a discount.\", \"A really beautifully appointed hotel in Antigua, with an extremely aesthetically appealing courtyard which is lit up with candles in the evening and multiple different terrace areas to explore and seek solace. A more international and exclusive clientele with international menu in the restaurant to match (delicious pesto pasta as a side note).   NB when booking that a double room may mean twin beds, and that some of the rooms are directly abutting the restaurant area - which is extremely convenient in some respects but also a bit unusual.   A nice bonus to have access to a little pool too.  Interestingly the hotel isn't an original colonial structure, but has been very sympathetically and authentically designed to deliver a lovely hotel building that seems like a rambling\", 'We had Christmas lunch here and were disappointed by the lack of ambience.  Intermittent/no music.  Tables decorated as they normally are.  Food was okay but served at room temperature so it quickly went cold.  A disappointing experience.  The whole entrance area needs a revamp.  We had previously stayed here 10 years ago and had lovely memories, which is why we chose it for lunch.  We were disappointed to find it had not aged well.  Staff welcoming.', 'Stayed for two nights as part of a GAP package trip (which may explain the low rate) and was most impressed by the hotel and the staff.   We were given a luxurious suite with a king and queen bed, everything was spotless and kept that way.  There is a fantastic roof terrace with great views over the town to the volcanoes.  Position is 10/15 minutes from the main square.    Antigua was by far my favourite town on the whole trip - attractive, low-key and quietly elegant.', 'Stayed here with a Gadventures tour. I had a room right at the top with a lovely view from the bathroom. Adequate room, mirror, double bed, plenty of light, compact but adequate bathroom.

Our room was a good value.  It was small but clean.  The private bathroom was also clean; however there was a small opening between the bathroom and the hallway high up on the wall.  There is a bar on the roof that was noisy, but staff shut it down at 11:00 PM and the hostel was quiet all night.  The staff insisted on holding our passports to ensure payment even though we paid cash in advance.  They claimed “everyone does it” but we have never encounter this practice. This would be a good place for young travelers looking to socialize and party.', 'Staff are excellent and very helpful. The place is very Clean and the Restaraunt on site is excellent and great value. The rooms are awesome with a large bed and good sized bathroom and shower. It can be noisy, but I believe most hotels in the area are as well due to the type of buildings. We will use again if we return to Antigua.

When you come by the reception desk, you walk through the eating area (great breakfasts!) and the bar, down to a central plaza with tables set up all around it. Our room was to the right & up the stairs, away from the hustle and bustle and the band, so fairly quiet. This is the best part of the hotel to book a room I think. Looked out on lots of plants & flowers. The room was large, clean with 2 beds, bathroom, small sofa, kitchenette with bottled water and a small table & chairs. Yes, you do hear the church bells every hour, but that is probably true of anywhere nearby. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Being near the Arch is a good landmark location if you get lost, and the hotel is near many restaurants and shops. I would', 'Noise in this place is just crazy. Church bells ring every half hour, the hotel loudspeaker play mariachi on full volume until 10pm and at 5pm traffic outside definitely picks up.

You will not get a good night sleep, because so many people come in and out all the time, they scream loudly in the hall, they will be drunk at 4 am and try to open doors. The hostel is falling apart - let me not mention the hygiene of the bathroom, the shower which you will be sharing with many people, the non-existent quality of the mattress (unless you like feeling springs on your back while you sleep), the tiny cramped room, the synthetic linens etc. Gosh I am so glad we are leaving today.', 'The hostel is beautiful, so much so that you might even forget yourself and believe you are in a boutique hotel. The staff is incredibly sweet and helpful.  However, our initial love for the place was soon replaced by incredible annoyance and frustration. It’s Sunday at 8am and they have been hammering away since 7:30am. The noise is so intense we were woken up by the hammering and sound of workers. ITS SUNDAY!?   And on top of that the rooms have a sky light (which does not have a black out) which also means you are woken up by the sunrise. Maybe the early morning would not have been a problem if not for the party they had until late the previous night.

The shared dorms offer bunk beds and they managed to make the individual beds quite private and sheltered which is really nice.

She helped book our coffee plantation tour (Finca Filadelfia), a cooking class (frijol feliz), our shuttle to Lake Atitlan, and gave us great food recommendations. They had a beautiful little garden area were we sat around and had the complementary coffee and tea.

Breakfast is not available in the hotel but the next door cafe, Fernando's (which I understood is owned by the hotel) offers great breakfasts and coffee. I was a bit put off by the rather excessive price for this hotel, but that may have to do with the fact that I stayed here on one of the busiest days of the year.

Clean and centric. Would stay there again if it was the only option but would look around first.', \"Our group of 30 thoroughly enjoyed this hotel during Holy Week.  The location is wonderful to see all of the processions, walk to great restaurants and shopping and see the sights.  We felt safe and well cared for.  Yes, the walls are a little thin, but so are most in Guatemala and Honduras.  There was excellent water pressure and the hot water in the shower was great.  No air-conditioning, but we didn't need it at all as it cooled off at night.  The staff was incredible helping with our massive amounts of luggage (we were on a mission trip and had donations and medical supplies) and took very good care of us.  We will definitely be back!\", \"Stayed here over the Halloween weekend in a private double.. Which was ok quality but not the best value for money compared to similar rooms in other hostels in the area (which were fully booked all weekend). Expected it to be a bit of a party hostel but didn't expect the terrace bar to be quite so noisy all though the day - the room was right underneath the bar and kitchen so we could hear the music and boxes and bottles being dragged around from 8am til midnight, not great if you needed a power nap (which we did after a nasty night bus down) or wanted to sleep in at all. Lots of locals or people from other hostels seemed to visit the bar and they tended to hog the upstairs bathroom (one of only three for the whole hostel) when they were around. The showers were a little tricky\", \"I arrived late and the hostel was very accommodating. The dorm was cramped and in average condition, and the bathrooms fairly standard, but what a view to wake up to! (with my free breakfast) -  It was my first impression of Antigua and it has lasted.  I know they offer quite a few activites (like a monday pub crawl) but i wasn't around long enough to experience them.\", \"The stay here was nice. I stayed in a private room with private bathroom and I had no problem at all. My friends stayed in a 4 person dorm and the problem was that the room was really small and it was humid. The shared bathrooms where not that well cleaned but for a backpacker it is fine. The terrace was really nice, without this I don't think I will go back to this hostel. \", 'We stayed in the Hotel Convento Santa Catalina four nights. Booking a room on the internet is always risky but I must say we were pleasantly surprised with this hotel. It’s location is excellent, right in the middle of town and close to restaurants, shops and touristic sites.  The entrance, where reception is found, opens up to a central courtyard with a fountain and is surrounded on all sides by corridors with cozy seats and decorated with beautiful antiques.  Our room was clean and big, with two queen sized beds that turned out to be very confortable to sleep on, a wardrobe and a desk.  The toilet had a tiled tub and plenty of hot water so all together we were very happy with our find.  We had breakfast one morning at the hotel and were pleased with the food, although', 'We arrived and the staff were beyond nice. However it was a bit strange for me that they offer snacks for an additional cost but they did not check that the bathroom was well equipped, we had to ask for toilet paper because the bathroom did not have any. don´t get me wrong, the snacks were a nice touch, but toilet paper is basic stuff that should not be missed, specially for guests that just checked in.', \"Don't be mistaken, this is a 2 star hotel at most. Definitely not what you would expect from the price they charge. There is not much to say, the only two things above the average in this hotel are the location and the price, as for the rest (rooms, the bed and bathroom) is like I said something you would expect from a B&B or even a hostel. Even more, the rooms are located around the hotel restaurant so its very noise, definitely not a good place to rest.\", 'While we did not stay at this hotel, we WISHED we had! Tucked almost directly under the Arch leading to the LaMerced Cathedral, the place is a hidden gem! We wandered in and discovered a beautifully restored convent, tastefully decorated with an assortment of plants, antiques, arts, and fascinating pieces. The various nooks and walkways invited our curiosity and begged us to enjoy their charm. We did have a delicious breakfast in the courtyard, lingering over coffee just to soak in the tranquility of the place!', 'This place is a gem and now that I am in Atilan and see this hotel isn’t as nice, I appreciate my time in Antigua. The great thing about this hotel is the grounds. They ate gorgeous!! The rooms are great except the floors are dirty or maybe I had a fluke. The service is amazing. I left tips every morning at my made to Order breakfasts (weekends are buffet) because they go Out of their way. I will be back if I visit. The staff are great!

Very average breakfasts...we gave up after two days and went out for breakfast. This place is well away (4 blocks and half a km) from the centre of town and on a quiet street.

The fact that the place has a locked gate and an armed guard tells you all you need to know about security concerns.', \"I didn't stay at the hostel so I cannot comment on that, but this is a review for the Acetenango hike organised through the hostel. Not sure how else to review this.  Everything about the hike was excellent, however, please note my comments.   The guide doesn't have command of even basic English, even though that was how it was sold. Paying for a porter, which was 200Q is only for ascent, and not the descent (dumb, really) but I was informed of this on top of the volcano. When I queried this at the reception, they were very dismissive of this telling me they had informed me. I selected vegetarian option for the hike, as I am veggie! I was given chicken noodle soup for the night dinner on the volcano. Not easy to change this sitting on a volcano. Veggie sandwiches, which I had\", \"The rooms are clean and acceptable.  They are bare bones.  There is no clock in the room, but there is shampoo, soap and towels.  The hotel courtyard is incredibly beautiful with lush plants everywhere.  I've stayed here before, and I'll stay here again.  This is an inexpensive hotel which I just love.  The breakfast in the morning is worth the $5 charge. There are many gathering places throughout the hotel courtyards, but the walls are thin so people have to be mindful of people wanting to get to bed early to catch an early morning flight. Containers of purified water are available throughout the courtyard of the hotel.\", 'Stayed here in late march.Rooms are decent, grounds are beautiful and the staff was friendly.location is fantastic you are within a short walking distance of the central park and many good restaurants.Stayed in two different rooms towards the back of the property and they were both very quiet.I reserved my first nights stay on the internet then decided to stay two more. It was considerably cheaper to pay at the hotel. I would stay here again.', 'The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because of the bed. The mattress was too firm and old for me but other then that the place is really nice and welcoming, friendly staff, clean rooms, hot shower, delicious breakfast and free coffee and water all day!   I will be back.', \"Location is in the center close to everything around.   The room met our needs and the atmosphere was wonderful.   I would stay here again in the future.  The only thing I am not used to is not having A/C. This really wasn't a deal breaker since it wasn't real hot. It would be a nice added touch.   Having in room wifi  would also be nice. The hotel had wifi but there were spots that were dead.   The walls are thin but we felt very safe at the hotel.   I didn't take advantage of the breakfast which was $5 USD but I did take advantage of the free coffee near the entrance of the hotel.   We had a small situation that the night staff fixed by allowing us to take another room which I really appreciated!   One suggestion take the time to learn some Spanish. The night crew didn't know\", 'We always enjoy staying in this quaint hotel.  Nice touches in the rooms; spotlessly clean.    I love the back courtyard and views from the terrace!

Lots of complimentary extras: free filtered water, coffee & tea available in reception, wifi & a nice communal courtyard area. There is a small gift shop set up in the reception area as well with local art, jewelry, organic coffee, tea & chocolate. Organic coffee shop right around the corner that was great for breakfast.

Unfortunately the case with D`Leyenda Hotel was not only the worst experience I have ever had: the parking lot is 6 blocks away from the hotel, there is a club beside the hotel that keeps you up until 1:30 AM, the room was smaller than the pictures show and to finish things up, I was woken up at 5:30 AM by the sound of people working in the restaurant preparing breakfast.

There are small windows to open to get some air but then you hear all of the noise from the courtyard. There is no air conditioning in the rooms and the rooms get hot. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are big. Small bathroom with no room to put anything anywhere. The worst part is the time it takes to get breakfast. It is included but it takes almost an hour to get your breakfast. Plus if you are there many days it is only the same thing every day, which gets old if you are there a week. The hotel itself is pretty nice but there are so many places to stay in Antigua that provide a better value. ', 'When we booked, we booked one double and one triple room (with 3 twins).  We were switched from the triple to a tiny room with 2 double beds when we arrived and the room was located in the very back next to the laundry which was quite noisy.  This got us off to a bad start.  Also the room had no available outlets for phone charging,etc.  Under different circumstances, we might have liked staying here.  They did serve a very nice breakfast but coffee is not available for early risers.

It's not expensive. The taste was good. There was a convenient next to the hotel as well. It's pretty a good location for me if there were some shops nearby. I was so sick when I traveled in Antigua. All of my tour group went to travel during the day, but I had to take a rest at the hotel, so, it's like I went to the pastry shop a lot because I didn't have enough power to walk too faraway from the hotel.

The rooms were small & basic with  the hotel just  a short walk from the main square. Not a great hotel but there is a shop just outside to buy drinks and snacks and a nice bakery next door which also does a tasty breakfast. We had a nice view of the volcano from our room which was a bomus but we saw more inviting hotels around Antigua.', \"This place is the type of place you get what you pay for.. Not much to it, quite simple.  It does have a daunting entrance, with the timber doors opening up to a nicer venue.  The hotel is different.  The rooms are quite dark and eery, the bathroom is very basic, but larger than i thought it would be.  No in room safe or air conditioner.  but that isn't much of a problem, as it is quite safe behind the high brick walls and solid timber gates, and the exposed concrete/brick rendered walls in the room act as a good insulator to keep the heat out.

Staff were really friendly and accommodating. Rooms were immaculate (we had a private room) and it was perfect. Beautiful courtyard, with a cool seating area and the breakfast was basic but delicious. The only negative was the music in the courtyard, it was a little loud, especially first thing in the morning - could have been a little more peaceful when waking (or maybe our room was right near the speaker?!). We would still return and the location was perfect.', \"Just 2 blocks from the central park, in a quite alley, banks and grocery-stores around the corner.  Prices gone up last months: now 250 Quetzales for a shared bathroom, 300 for a private (only 1 room available if I'm correct). Good price for a clean room, oke bed. Toilets are kept very clean about 6 times a day! Lovely hotel-owner.  To say 1 negative point; breakfast is served right next to one of the bathrooms/ toilets, so awkward noises could be part of your pancakes...  Definately stay here again.  Antigua is a must btw; so much history in a small town, not too touristy, handy point to travel further.\", 'Everything was fine until the room next to me (second floor) was occupied.

Unfortunately on my first day, when I came back from visiting Antigua, some uninvited people stole my electronic stuff of my room. They were simply able to remove the lock, by twisting the ring. I informed the owner and he called the police. Seems that 2 men misleaded the daughter and another one went upstairs and took my stuff.  Although the owner immediately said I don't have to pay for my room, I still have my doubts. For some reason he didn't change or replace the lock, so it could easily happen again.   Also it happend the first after the room cleaned. The other days they didn't clean the room anymore.

The rooms are very small but when you are in Antigua who wants to stay in the room anyways!! The breakfast was ok. Attention was also Ok. the price was very good. We enjoyed our stay and we will go back with our baby.', \"I stumbled by this quaint hotel in search of a quiet reasonable place to stay while in Antigua. I didn't want to spend much as I knew I would be outside the room or day tripping from Antigua. The hotel is relatively clean and the room I had was very basic with 2 beds and small windows that opened high on the wall and over the courtyard eating area of the hotel. The owner gave me a good price for staying for 7 nights.   I found the water pressure of the shared bathrooms good and the facilities basically clean and not fancy. My bed was comfortable enough and the pillows fine. I was able to leave the room for 2 days while I took a smaller pack to Lake Atitlan. It was safe and quiet after 8:30.

The rooms are nicely decorated in tranquil Myan décor. The rooms and shared bathroom were extremely clean and the cleaning staff were very sweet. The staff changed the sheets daily and they cleaned the bathroom throughout the day. The hotel had internet access and computers in the reception area for a very decent price.

We also had the buffet breakfasts and the staff was attentive and the menu varied and very good each day.  We were a group of dancers and again the staff accommodated us by allowing us to use the terraza for our evening events. Other guests also joined us for the dances.

You can get just as good food for 1/2 the price in quite a few other places.  But, I kind of expect to pay higher prices as a hotel, and the atmosphere was rather nice.  However, something else spoiled the meal.  We paid in cash, and there was some kind of problem.  They tried to hide the problem from us.  From what I could tell, our waiter was not allowed to keep his tip.  He had separated his tip from the bill, and it became clear that someone else higher up the food chain wanted his tip money.

It may have been due to the season we visited in though. Overall, a pleasant experience but with a couple of inconveniences.', \"With all of the competition in Antigua, I can see why places might be struggling to stay current and upgrade bedding and pillows as they get old. Although this was a very clean room and shared bathroom, it really didn't feel that way just because the mattress was too soft and bent easily and the pillow was really lumpy. Coming from traveling in Asia, I would prefer to sleep on a covered wooden platform because it would feel less likely to hold critters. Also, we opted for the shared bathroom, which the one near our room basically wasn't closed at the top for ventilation purposes. That would be fine if no one was ever home or eating, but this really is someone's home. The family seems to live in a very small portion if the house, but every room faces the inner courtyard.

Solo. A friend who had stayed here in the past suggested this place because the price was very good: about $25/night including breakfast. She said I would be safe; it was family run. All her advice proved true. The hotel is at the end of a dead end road. My first impression: sparse room, outdated, worn, colorful decor, friendly owners. I thought it was the type of place I would have appreciated as a traveling college student or in my early married years when money was tight. My room had its own bath--some guests had to share. One window in the room--no a.c. One spider--not poisonous.

We ordered soup,steak in a pepper steak, chicken in a pepper sauce, and a bottle of Zinfandel wine.  Each element could be slightly criticized: the soup was unexciting, the chicken was too salty,the steak was cooked less than the requested level, and most wine selections were quite expensive.  But having said this, it was still a wonderful experience. The environment is stunningly beautiful, and the staff were competent.  In the \"cave\", where we dined, there was live music,but we had to pay an additional $10 for the pleasure.

Daniel and Marleni were both very helpful and kind, and always greeted us in the mornings with helpful tips and suggestions.\", 'The rooms and bathrooms are large and spacious.

A good budget alternative in Antígua.', \" I stayed multiple nights at Las Camellias. I especially enjoyed the terrace with great views of volcanos on two sides, and the patio garden. The rooms were reasonably priced, with fans and excellent wifi.  An open window or door allows some fresh air into rooms that open only onto the courtyard. It is true that walls are thin, but that appears to be the case everywhere. Asking for the room at the end of the upstairs terrace meant sharing a wall with only 1 neighbor and people were generally considerate. On Saturday night the music from a nearby disco is loud, so bring your earplugs if you don't enjoy the music. The breakfast is okay, for a $5 additional charge.

I liked that there was breakfast included and there is a restaurant/bar on site.  The only drawback to this place was the location although it is not bad.  It was about 5-6 blocks from the central square and the streets are really dark and desolate late in the evening so we opted to use a tuktuk instead of walking back to the hotel from the arch area.  We felt safe at this hotel and overall felt very safe in Antigua.  I just felt more comfortable riding back versus walking later at night.', 'Nice location with a few restaurants nearby, but still pretty quiet. Lovely room and courtyard garden. The included breakfast was nothing special but the service in the restaurant was good and the counter staff were all very helpful and friendly.', 'Stayed in February as part of a tour group . The hotel is conveniently placed just a short walk from the main square and the best sights in this beautiful old city . It is a four square building around a pretty garden courtyard . The room allocated to me was a little gloomy with no AC , comfortable bed , usual furnishings and a satisfactory bathroom . Due to travel delays we arrived too late for an evening meal . Breakfast was served in a pretty covered dining area but with limited choice . Our problem was that the rooms allocated to our group were in the single storey terrace adjacent to the road outside . This road becomes a chicken bus race track from about 5.30/6.00 am . You WILL be woken up by engine noise as these buses are literally one meter away from your bathroom', 'We lived in Antigua for five years, so we know the area very well.  We selected this hotel for our return visit because we knew it was both centrally located and reasonably priced.  We were happy with our choice, as the room had plenty of space, the courtyard was pleasant, and the staff were wonderfully friendly, helpful, and welcoming.  Some nights it was a little noisy there until about 9:30 or 10:00 p.m. (due to the restaurant, and a party one night), but we are fairly late-nighters, so we were not bothered by this.  We would definitely recommend this hotel, especially to those who (as we do) enjoy being immersed in history.', 'We went for dinner and it was quite tasty. The presentation was nice too. The kids meal was nice and small. Pasta was tasty and so were the fries. Great homemade chips. They have live music playing after 7 but we came before and they were not very busy. A lovely atmosphere. ', \"My family and I stayed in an apartment very close to here so decided to give it a try for breakfast. We ended up going back every morning for our time in Antigua. The surroundings are beautiful and it is very peaceful. The wait staff are very friendly and helpful. We tried just about every breakfast on the menu and we enjoyed them all, our kids enjoyed the local dishes as much as the French toast and pancakes. If you like to have a cappuccino or latte, ask for it strong(fuerte) as it is like hot milk, that is the only thing we had to say was not spot on. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.\", 'This is a stunning location and accommodation house. Located right under the famous Arch of Antigua, the hotel is in a building that is almost 500 years old. Now the rooms are spacious and the atrium full of plants and a fountain. The decor is excellent and sets a wonderful, historic mood. However - beware light sleepers! The convent includes classic monastery bells that ring in the hour, 24 hours a day. They ring in the hour twice at midnight and at 0600, so if you or partner might be light sleepers, it can be a real nuisance. Take earplugs!', 'Situated in what is possibly one of the most desirable locations in Antigua, one block from the central square and one and a half from the arch, Hotel Casa Antigua could have pretty much everything going for it, despite it being a budget hotel and not a luxury residence: three carefully maintained courtyards with handsome, mature planting and exquisite water features, complemented by attractive sitting areas in the first two; an imposing main house surrounding the first courtyard, with striking rooms boasting original 18th-century woodwork, crystal chandeliers, and four-post beds; lovely views of the volcanoes and some of the surrounding ruins can be enjoyed from the roof terrace, a space with infinite potential. The cobalt-blue sky of Antigua provides an astounding backdrop for', 'We had a great 3 night stay in early February.  Our room was tastefully furnished and included a fireplace for chilly nights (which we did not need to use).  The staff deserves special mention as all were extremely helpful and friendly.  We enjoyed the breakfasts on the roof patio with a view of Agua Volcano in the morning light.  The location is perfect and just a few steps away from the central plaza of old Antigua.  Our room was very quiet and we slept well. Our only suggestions: 1) our room had a bit of a musty smell which could be a problem for someone with allergies or sensitivities, 2) We could have used a bit more lighting in the room for reading, and 3) breakfasts were enjoyable but could use the addition of a little protein (eggs, meat, beans, cheese or yoghurt). ', \"We spent a weekend here during a sunset festival powered by corona. It's a really nice place, we stayed in a private room, beds were comfortable, there was no hot water in the shower. Our room was next to a hallway so we heard everything at all times, it's a party hostel so people come and go at all times. The bar is really nice and they have a pretty awesome setup with a bus turned into a living room, a pool and hammocks.\", 'My roommate and I booked two shuttles through Selina, Antigua. The first from Antigua to Panajachel and the second back. Both experiences were absolutely terrible! The first day, we missed half of our day at Atitlan Lake because the shuttle forgot to pick us up, and when we tried to contact Selina to notify them, the phone line they gave us did not work. Then when we finally got through to them on Facebook messenger, it took them two hours to figure out what the issue was and finally get an employee of some sort to pick us up in his own personal vehicle, which did not look like it should have been on the road at all. Then, for the shuttle back, we were told to meet at Selina Atitlan in Panajachel where we did, and on time. Nobody seemed to know what was going on or that we had a', 'Very simple and clean. Staff very friendly. No air but fans provided. I would definitely stay there again.  Great especially if you are on a budget.

Take the stairs from the courtyard to the top of the hotel for an amazing view of the natural beauty.  The rooms were great! However, housekeeping and overall service is not up to a 5-star value. The hotel's website state they have live music, which was appreciated but the noise from the dining area was also a major distraction.  Its a great place to stay and beautiful! I do recommend staying here just be aware that the service, especially wifi and breakfast, are a little behind a 5-star. This in mind, the $200 per night was a little costly given my experience.\", 'Have stayed here many times in the past fifteen years. It is clean and quiet .   Rooms a bit on the small  side which can be warm if it is warm in Antigua.  About 4 blocks from Parque Central and close to many restaurants.

It isn't too expensive, the location is great, hot showers, wifi, right next door to fernando's cafe, it's pretty great overall. :) I stayed here just for one night to escape and it was perfect for that.

I think they choose this place because it's so affordable.\", 'Had a great stay here , rooms are done up very well , small outside area to our room  We had dinner in the restaurant which was very good but quite pricey (esp wine list)  Breakfast was above average, served in a dining room  Rooftop areas were quiet , lots of character to this hotel  We’ll be back one day !', 'I stayed here for one night on my way through Antigua and my first impression of this hotel was amazing. The room (number 6 i believe-the one with the hammock on the patio) was lovely and had a great view of the courtyard. The restaurant on site was good but a little disappointing. I had the escargot and risotto which were both a little bland, but the service was impeccable and they were very accommodating of my lack of Spanish. The young man working the front desk was incredibly helpful even before I arrived arranging shuttles and answering questions for me. The only reason I rated this hotel 4 stars was because after a very long day traveling I was ready to get some rest, but the noise from the restaurant was too loud to sleep!

Good breakfast, it's a bit further away from the center of town, but it's totally walkable and easy if you use a tub tub.\", 'For the price I paid (luxury room in the garden portion of the hotel), I did not expect an outdated bathroom and a rather lengthy walk to any hotel facility. The breakfast was at times a little bit chaotic, and the swimming pool was constantly surrounded by families due to some group party organised in the hotel for a couple of days. I did expect some serene atmosphere (looking to the pictures), but it turned out to be an overcrowded place.', \"If you choose to stay at a B&B for ambiance, then Chez Daniel is Not for you. There is essentially no greenery or garden; no place to rest and relax. The one lounge chair there was torn, and there was no place to get comfortable.  We stayed, based on previous reviews,  despite the location being an extra 15 minute walk from most of the sites. Unfortunately it was noisy-- while there is music all over the city, which is actually a nice flavor of the culture, we were subjected to the pounding bass of someone's music both nights (Like the stereo coming through the walls of an apartment). Of all the hotels and B&Bs we stayed at in Guatemala, Chez Daniel was the only place I had to use earplugs to sleep. I knew beforehand that there was no real breakfast. I think they use the word\", \"I stayed at Posada de San Carlos 9 nights altogether. The owners, Carlos and Hazel were great and gave me a discount for staying a longer period of time. The staff, José Luna, Emma and Marco were very helpful and friendly. My room was at the back so very quiet and private. The location is just a few blocks from Parque Central on a very interesting street with great boutiques and restaurants. The only thing I would change is free drinking water for the guests so we don't have to keep buying the bottles.  A very clean, friendly and comfortable place to stay!\", 'Really a nice and clean place to stay with a family atmosphere, great rooftop views, access to a kitchen and great staff.

Indifferent staff  It may be cheap, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. And it's not THAT cheap.\", \"We couldn't extend our reservation because The Terrace was so popular!  BUT: the bar is great if you're a party person, if less so go for a quieter hostel.  The staff were VERY helpful, and had lots of great tips.\", \"Lively hostel with a terrace bar - which is where everyone goes to drink. Great for a drunken, sociable evening but not great when you are awake at 430am to climb acatenango! We stayed on the second floor which meant everyone going in/out of the bar would walk past our room. Stayed one night in a downstairs room which was quieter. Breakfast is included (but coffee/tea not included) - get the pancakes! The owners and desk staff were all friendly and helpful and gave some really good restaurant recommendations! Good location - really close to the market and easy walking distance to anywhere you'd need to go. \", \"I'd like to given this place more, it's in a great location with a nice communal area outside that has a good sunny and shaded areas. The rooms were functional without Aircon and were small. I'm British living in London so I'm used to small but having travelled around America by their standards this is minute. Same goes for the bathroom. Ours room had a sink that constantly dripped and soaked the floor which wasn't ideal. I don't accept the arguments that hotels sometimes make that we should have highlighted it, and they would have fixed it, as the cleaners would have seen it everyday so plainly ignored the problem, I'm a guest I shouldn't have to complain about obvious defects to have them corrected.

The dead end street was kind of creepy as well.  The worst part of my one night stay was the noise.  A drunk man yelling from yard of the people that lived next door and then as he quieted down the guys who were staying next door sat in the patio chatting which was like an echo chamber into my room.When they finally moved inside next door it was not much better. The next morning I moved to Casa Cristina which was a few dollars more, but sooo much nicer.. light. bright and pretty.. no comparison.

Cons: 1) Excellent location. You’re in the heart of the action, which means you do get some noise from the surrounding neighborhood. There is nothing the hotel can do about the noise from outside the hotel…either join the fun or bring ear plugs. (To be fair, we only were bothered by the noise on Saturday night.)  2) I have arthritis, and found the beds to be', \"The best thing about this hotel is the location which is steps away from the central plaza. The private courtyard is lovely although we never spotted anyone actually using it except while waiting for a shuttle to leave. The not- so-good thing is that while all the rooms have the same price, they vary widely in quality. Our first night we ended up in a small, dark, musty and freezing room with 2 beds, one of which had a bad mattress. On the next day, after hard negotiation we were moved to a much better room. This issue makes the hotel a risky proposition as you cannot tell what you'll get if you book on the Internet. I would recommend staying here only if you can physically be there to choose a room.\", \"For Q320 a night it's good value. It's a hotel, not a hostel. No dorm rooms.

We extended our stay we were happy with the service. No breakfast on offer, but no real problem.   The biggest problem was the noise. The rooms have a window onto the corridor. Very strange. But it is slated glass so cant really be fully closed. It meant that you could hear everything when people chatted whilst walking passed. You could also hear the neighbouring rooms easily.

Economically it is a bargain that is a clean, well-run hotel with  no frills but no short cuts either. The staff is knowledgeable,  helpful, and exceptionally friendly.  As to location, you are a very short distance from the Central Park, which is the heart of Antigua.  The park is framed on every side by historic municipal buildings and colonial neighborhoods converted into beautiful shops and restaurants.The cathedral is on the east side and the whole scene is overlooked by Volcan Agua from the south, which shadows your every movement so you are never lost.

I recommend requesting a modern room towards the back, which has less of the restaurant traffic.', 'I felt like I stepped back in time.  The decor was authentic and the setting was beautiful.

I loved this place! Totally recommend this quaint hotel. ', 'I booked one week in advance and i was told that on my third night the price will rise... Which i agreed, but when i show up, they decided that my second night was more expensive also... Which i dont think is cool of them. As any party hostel, the toilet shared by two dorms of 12-15 people each, was so uncleaned, people come back at night stincking alcohol and cause they are so pissed, they snore so loud...

It's only a few blocks to walk to Central Park but at night, it's recommended to take a taxi back to the hotel as the streets are empty at that end of town.  The staff are super friendly and helpful and speak decent English, but the restaurant and housekeeping staff mostly speak Spanish.

My advise is find somewhere else to stay if you can especially on a Friday or Saturday night.', \"The staff at the hotel was extremely courteous and gracious. Due to my airlines's fault, my connection was missed and I arrived in Guatemala a day later than planned. Even though almost any other hotel would have charged me for the night, D'Leyenda did not.

There are 2 large dogs that live in the reception, so if you are allergic or just not fond of dogs, avoid this place.

As the stairs up to the terrace are made of wood, the trampling there alone is kind of aweful. Also you can hear anything happening outside your room, especially the shared bathroom, that is pretty much frequented.

You do get free filtered water though which is nice. I stayed in a dorm which was fine and not too noisy as it was on the ground floor.

There are a variety of rooms available from doubles (patio) to quad rooms (garden view), most of whom face an open central courtyard.

One thing to note when making the reservation, ask about prices and then ask if the prices are CHEAPER if using cash instead of credit card. For us, they charged $10 less if we paid with cash.\", \"Until las camelias, we've never left a hotel before the end of our stay. One hour after arriving, we grabs our bags and headed to another hotel.  This was our 8th trip to Guatemala, and we decided to try something new. We arrived at camelias about 2:30 P.M., and were greeted by a pleasant enough receptionist who gave us the key to our first floor room. The maid was finishing up mopping the floor, so we toured the hotel for a few minutes and returned. The room was tiny, with no closets or anywhere to hang clothes. It was so small that we couldn't open our bags. No windows gave us a stuffy feeling of being locked in with the smell of cleaning solvents, and a soaking wet floor. The room was cell like.   The door to the room was not secure, and seemed like anyone could open it with\", ' We were just in Antigua from Aug 16-18. The terrace was great! There is an upstairs bar that has great drink deals and makes it easy to meet new people. The staff is very helpful too. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a hostel.', \"It was a great experience, we didn't mind about the bar in the ground floor as we were in the 4th story. The room was comfy, clean and warm. The only thing I would complain is that there was only one sachet of shampoo and a tiny soap for both of us to share, everything else was awesome, the attention and location.\", 'I arrived late on my first night (10:30 pm) and did not know about the bar on the ground floor. For the second night, I moved to another room supposedly away from the bar and should be quieter. Another issue - no wifi connection on this next room and has same loud bar noise.  The cost per night per person is about 20 US$. The rooms on the second floor are for 2 persons or more; represented to be quieter.  Good Points: very near the Central Park and other attractions of Antigua. Restaurants, shops and grocery stores are near by. Hotel staff can make shuttle arrangements. Newish bathrooms  Tips: Use earplugs to help you get sleep. Choose rooms near the Reception/Front Desk for faster Wifi connection.  ', 'I stayed here recently for one night and for a second time. Great location just off the main square. Small but very comfortable room with terrific shower. Very helpful lady at check in. Free WiFi. There is a nice coffee shop downstairs. I will stay here again.', \"La Sin Ventura is a relatively inexpensive hotel located within a half block of Antigua's central park. It is squarely in the tourist zone and is surrounded by restaurants and several points of interest. The rooms are sparse but clean and well decorated, the bathrooms bright and the water pressure in the shower is a delight. The best part about this hotel is the staff; they always have a pleasant word to say and they go out of their way to please.       As others have already noted, this hotel is directly above a discoteca that opened for business well after the hotel started. The hallways are tile and do an exellent job at carrying the sound into the rooms. So if you are a early bird and not a sound sleeper, then this may not be an ideal choice for you. The music did end\", \"This was surprisingly a very enjoyable place to stay. It's not the usual place I would pick on a vacation but since the majority of our team was staying here it was convenient. Of course for the price you know you won't be staying in a lavish environment so keep that in mind. This is a no frills, minimalist type of approach. Staff was very pleasant, laundry can be done daily for a small fee. The rooms are clean. The bathrooms are small but there was hot water the majority of the time. One of the major drawbacks was the noise at night but it wasn't horrible. I would advise ear plugs just in case. This place definitely exceeded my expectations. The location is great, close to the center of town and easy walking distance to  restaurants,stores. I wouldn't pick this for small\", \"I considered giving it 5 fobs. If it was slightly cheaper or the beds slightly more plush, I likely would have. Antigua is an atmospheric tourist town where hoteliers appear to compete qualitatively. There are a lot of attractive superior properties in the $50-100 per night range. If paying more, I hope you get something truly special because there's a lot of quality in the mid-range properties and some super value among lesser priced hostels. After a week home stay in language school at San Pedro on Lake Atitlan, Casa Antigua was very inviting (my teens endorsed the place). We stayed in a slightly higher priced triple on the front court yard.  The hotel is a classic old aristocrat's home converted to hotel of which Antigua has many.  Wifi issues in certain rooms? My son noted\", 'Small, intimate hotel. Friendly staff, comfortable beds, clean & safe (street entrance locked at night). No A/C but a fan was provided & I comfortable sleeping with windows open. Excellent location...close to central plaza & several eating places. WiFi coverage in courtyard/reception area. This was my 2nd stay and I would stay again.', \"This hotel was a good place to stay for the couple of nights we had in Antigua.  There were pros and cons - on the positive side it is a charming garden/courtyard where you can have your breakfast and its in a super location very near the town plaza etc.  There is a great view from the roof terrace.  They can provide a very generous breakfast for $5 US (but coffee lovers will prefer to go elsewhere for their hit!).  The wifi didn't work in our room only at reception and in courtyard to a certain extent.  We didn't get much helpful information about local places to eat at reception (but perhaps this is because day receptionists seem to be much more knowledgeable than night ones and we arrived later in the day).  Our hotel door could be pushed open even when locked and no safe is\", 'Wanted to give 5 stars but our experience was a bit mixed. Hotel has the cool factor, grounds, rooms were pristine, location perfect. Breakfast - great selection. Check in - we were not able to check in until 3pm which made for a long wait (6 hours!) Our rooms were across the road from the main hotel area. This was ok but on Saturday nights they cater for weddings in this area, and unfortunately this particular one partied until 2:20am! Not so good when you have a 3:30am pick up! Out of a two night stay we had turn down service for one night which was a lovely touch. Honestly was a lovely hotel but avoid the weekends if you want peace and quiet.', \"The porta hotel has wonderful food and a great spa.... the rooms in 500 section are much quieter from the 300's and a nice smaller pool close by..... great location and lovely staff...the couches in the front are soooo comfortable and a great meeting spot.\", 'I wonder why people, especially from North America are so nasty when talking about small hotels and tour operators, especially when they are based in Latin America!  We bought this cheap vacation package, that we found on a travel blog in one of our local Russian website, we hesitate at first to use Vacation Super Deals especially after reading some comments that people made in the past, but I have to say that we were very happy to book the trip anyway.   They are simply amazing, the hotel (which is called in Guatemala a Posada) was great, sure it was not a 5***** hotel, how could it be at this price? Nice, clean, romantic setting and nice vegan breakfast (as we are vegan and requested it).  The transfers were on time, most of them even even private, using great mini vans, and', 'We stayed here for over 5 nights in total. Three nights at first then a break for two, finally returning for another two, and both times it was fantastic. The staff were more than willing to direct you to the nearest landmark and attractions, with their maps.   Wonderfully situated close--by to the main square Posada La Merced provided the tranquillity need in this bustling city. With ability to climb all the way onto the roof (4 stories one of the best views of the whole city and surrounding mountains can be obtained. To be honest this one location on the roof with your own crate of beers or rum served as the best bar in the whole of Antigua.    Rooms were comfy, our bathroom was a little small but no complaints, everything worked!  But mainly as I said staff were accommodating', 'When I entered the hotel everything was beautiful and seemed very quiet which is normal during the low season. An older white lady with at reception who looked a little like Meryle Streep was on the phone. I waited a couple minutes and when she finished the conversation there was very little exchange at all. She acted as if I wasn\\'t even in the room.  Another worker came and motioned me to view the rooms and everything seemed nice enough so I headed back down to reception to take a room. Again she was so short and acted a bit bothered to even converse with me. It was mentioned this hotel might include breakfast so I asked and her short hasty response was \"No not at this price\" and that was the most she ever really said. That\\'s perfectly fine since I spent 250Q which is around', 'We got a really nice room with a private bath for $30US.  The private bath turned out to be very important as I got pretty sick while we were staying at Casa Rustica (unrelated to the hotel, I assure you).  As a result of being sick we had to change some plans - the staff at the hotel were more than accommodating, even going so far as to get up at 4am to let our shuttle driver know that our plans had changed!  We were very grateful for their help and for being so understanding.', 'I stayed here for one week.I would book here again because the staff is accommodating and very friendly, they have laundry/Spanish lessons (fee service) on site, billiards/drinks on site for a fee, clean kitchen, clean rooms (daily room service with towels), clean bathrooms (the shared bathroom by room #6 has a shower that clogs so the water backs up a bit).  There was a rooster next door that liked to make noise at all hours of the night, but nothing horrible.  Noisy on the weekends but I would assume that it is like that way at many places downtown.  The location overall is great (close to the park, close to many popular restaurants)    The price we were quoted at was $49/night for 3 people with private bathroom and $69/night for 3 people on the weekend.  It was more than I', \"My boyfriend and I stayed in Casa Rustica for 3 nights over New Years. As other people have discussed, the noise level was very high, although we did expect this having read the reviews and with it being New Years week. There was a rooster every morning that kept us up, and I know of another couple who switched hotels because of this. It didn't bother us too much, but something to note. The noise level is, as others have said, high.   That said, we thought the hotel was average. We loved the location and loved the rooftop patio. It was quiet, a good place to lie and read a book and had a fantastic volcano view. We originally booked our hotel for 4 nights and when we needed to switch to 3 in order to squeeze in a trip to Semuc Champey, we were given a lot of grief. We appreciate\", \"Nice location and well maintained hotel, but the price was relatively high, in my opinion.  The staff was helpful (albeit obviously unenthusiastic) with check-in and travel arrangements.  The bar next door is ridiculously loud on weekends, which a sign in the room indicated, but the music dies down after 1am.  If you're looking for peace and quiet, then I recommend spending a few dollars more and checking in at Hotel Casa Antigua.    One other minor observation for the owner: it would be very helpful to post the wifi password in the guest rooms or provide it at check-in.  I can't think of a good reason why guests should have to request it every time.\", \"If you can get it , strongly recommend the Grand Suite (room 12) which has wonderful volcano view from the bedroom - costly at over $300 a night but fully worth it. We also stayed in another Junior Suite at the back of the hotel for our final night and it wasn't anywhere near as nice - darker, no view but quieter. The main downside of the Grand Suite was the noise particularly when you get a large group of loud diners sitting below or live music (which is most nights) . So if you like to go to sleep early this may not be for you. The other downsides of the hotel are a) it is a little way from the centre and the sidewalk is not in good shape so it is not for the unfit, and b) the terraces are not private, but shared.

It\\'s also a quick walk to the \"old\" market. It\\'s fairly new from what I understand, and still rough around the edges, but made up for the \"work-in-progress\" in many ways, location being top of the list.  The food is great if you don\\'t feel like eating in town for some reason, and though casual, there are few rooftops where you can enjoy a meal and a drink while watching smoke billow out the top of a volcano during sunset.  This is the kind of place that allows you to appreciate what it means to live at the base of a volcano, and in a town that is trying to maintain it\\'s authenticity while accommodating our touristic wants.

It is a delight to walk around  here, early in the morning. The hotel has a nice restaurant, with a view at the garden. Breakfast was a filling plate with good bread. The hotel is at walking distance of the main plaza and the restaurants in town.

Then as we arrived at 2pm with checkin at 3pm, she told us we were too early and the room is not ready yet. We said could we just leave our luggage, and we would walk around. But since they didn't seem to want to store our luggage, and we weren't leaving, they then proceeded to give us the keys to our room, which was of course ready.  Room was spacious, but annoyingly only one bottle of water, which was the first time we haven't had two per room on our travels.  No complimentary tea or coffee available in room or lobby.  First day breakfast buffet. The second, we were served a very basic simple meal.  Had to leave $50\", 'The room we were in smelled of mildew.  They charge Q8 (about $1.00) per hour for the WiFi which you can only purchase in cash, one hour at a time, and the sign-in is only usable one device (so no sharing an hour with others).  They also block cell phone reception for some reason.', \"We stayed here for 6 nites over Semana Santa week - and we had a consistent, great stay. Hotel is well located (5min walk to Parque Central), but still on a quiet street. Although it looks unassuming from the street - as most places in Antigua, behind the stores boasts a nice lobby, quiet gardens, and perfect dining/breakfast spot with shaded gardens to eat. If you're looking for a big, resort type feel with a pool - this is not it (try the Porta a few blocks away). However if you're looking for reliable customer service, pleasant room and surroundings and authentic Antiguian architecture, you've found it. Great stay. Ps - there is a 24 hour front porter, very secure location and building.  \", 'Good over all place.  Remember, Guatemala is a 3rd world Country.

That is very important to me when in Antigua.  The hotel also has a restaurant, placed in a courtyard setting.  The new owner has plans to clean up and develop adjacent ruins.

We had a meal in the evening and it was fine, but there wasnt a big choice. The breakfast was plated for us as we were in a tour group and was nothing special. There was a computer in the reception area and  it could  be used for a few dollars charge.', 'When we arrived the lights flickered and went out and emergency generation was required.  Some of the group got hot water but some did not and the TV in our room did not work. The hotel maintenance staff (who came very quickly) were unable to fix it that day, but managed to get it working on our second day.  Breakfast was good, the rooms large and comfortable, but reception was slower than normal when we arrived.  Antigua is full of interesting churches and convents, and the hotel is about six blocks from the centre- within walking distance of main sights, but the street signs are noticeably in short supply. The Casa del Jade is worth a visit, and it has a nice restaurant, but NB smoking is not even allowed on the open terraces. We had  soup at the hotel in the evening Sopa', \"I stayed for 3 nights. My room was comfortable, although a little small. Location of the hotel is excellent, almost adjacent to the square without the hustle and bustle.  There was a little noise from the Ocelot bar, but not loud enough to be a nuisance.  The staff are fantastic .... and this in my opinion makes the place.  Breakfast was good.  I found their prices of US$80/night for 1 person a little high relative to other hotels in Antigua of the same quality.  There's a 10% surcharge for credit cards.\", 'Each room at the D\\'Leyenda Hotel has a name that corresponds to a local legend. Ours was El Carreton, or The Death Wagon, a ghost carriage drawn by black horses that is said to announce an imminent death.  It is the last room at the end of the very narrow courtyard of the hotel. We were taken there by a bubbly American student who called everyone \"you guys\" - jarring after several weeks of polite Spanish hospitality - but only after she had first installed us in the wrong room. The odd thing is that we requested a room with a fireplace at the time of booking several weeks earlier and were told that the hotel was full, except for El Carreton. In fact, except for ourselves, it was completely empty.  El Carreton has a window which opens into a storage and utility area used by', 'We were very pleased that we stayed here.

However, there is loud, booming music Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from the disco on the ground floor.  I was surprised to learn that this was owned by the hotel's owners, who seemed not to care about offering chances for peaceful sleep to guests these nights.  The commotion stops at 1:00 A.M. and is less heard in one of the rooms deeper in the back.\", 'Great location for access to everything!  Clean rooms!  Staff is very friendly, yet professional.

I was REALLY impressed with the thought that went into designing the dorm room.  Each bed had curtains for privacy (and to protect against those partiers who come in at 3am and turn the lights on).

For me it wasn't a problem, but for others it may well be and it did ring every thirty minutes while we were there.  Parking is at a lot about 2 blocks away, or between 3-5 minutes depending on how fast you walk. You could take a Tuk-Tuk but that seems like more effort than is needed. You can pull up on side of the hotel (the street in front is blocked to vehicular traffic from 7 am to 10 pm or so) and someone from the hotel will get your bags and then you can head to the parking lot.

The grounds are pretty and well-maintained.  The location is very convenient to walking to local landmarks and restaurants and the area is safe and comfortable.    The minor drawbacks include the lack of warm water (which shouldn't be a huge surprise traveling in Central America) which one morning turned into a complete lack of water (mid-shower) though the staff were quick to resolve the problem.  Also, there is a lack of air circulation as the window openings do not have screens. Luckily it was cool at night during our stay.    The major drawback is the bell in the clock tower.  It rings all night long.  On the hour, quarter and half.  Sometimes 11 or 17 times\", \"Stayed here for one night in April and I have to say I was expecting much better. This is a former convent now a hotel. The location is spot on being close to the centre of town and attached to the famous arch.   On the downside I found it to be way overpriced for what it was; the room was large and had a bathroom. The bathroom was a bit smelly and the room itself pretty run down. Granted though, it does have character.   The hotel has parking although this is a 5 minute walk down the road in a separate property. Ideally you would take a tuk tuk (as we did) as the pavements can be difficult to manouvre.

I met a couple of amazing people, but overall didn’t have such a great experience, because the hotel showers sprung a leak, and water came out over entire shower/toilet area, and some of it leaking through cracks into the main dormitory area.  It took till mid-afternoon till they could fix it.  (I still have to get used to the slow service being from a more developed country, and it may be their way of keeping operational costs low.)

In the dorm I stayed at, there was outlets around all of the beds, which is really convenient to charge your phone while you sleep. I also liked that there was a female dorm, which is sometimes hard to find in hostels in Guatemala and Central America. Internet seems to be relatively fast most of the time.

Beds are changed everyday and they are super clean. Bar is great, food is pretty good, pool area is awesome and a cute little cat stays there to. There wasn't much of a vibe when we were there everyone kept to themselves, so if you want a party hostel I wouldn't recommend this one.

The staff were fairly accommodating and we were given a good price for the tours we booked in comparison with other travel agents we had received quotes from.   The third party tour companies they used were good but Onvisa's drivers for collection and drop off are quite tardy and enjoy making unnecessary stops which adds to your journey.

The room had a faint musty smell and was  tired.  The real problem was the noise. During the night for 3 separate nights there was what sounded like people running across the roof. It was really noisy,enough to wake you up, as well as a bit startling to say the least. We thought burglars were being chased across roofs.

Another problem I found was the shower head was too high and the shower curtain too low. This led to water spilling all over the bathroom once done showering.

Their car park guy managed to scratch my big SUV when trying to get it through their very, very, narrow driveway.

I was only there one night.  I'm writing this because the room was very noisy, I think there were windows that didn't close all the way, and the curtains weren't completely lined so there was a lot of light coming in all night.  Which was odd, becuase there wasn't an electrical outlet anywhere in the room.  My friend down the hall had electricity, but I had to recharge my phone at the front desk, which was fine.\", \"Over the last three years I have stayed at Santa Catalina Hotel a number of times and eaten at the restaurant. I have also read a number of reviews about this property on tripadvisor so here is my take on the hotel.  This is a very old building in the heart of Antigua Guatemala so location is excellent you are staying almost under the famed arch of Antigua. If you are looking for a 4 star hotel this is not it. I mean in my mind it is but, for some travelers they just don't get it.   Some noise exists around the rooms cannot be helped, part of the charm is the bells toll on the famed arch and you may have a room facing the arch. Yes you will here them. Other rooms surround the court yard and restaurant yes you may hear some noise. After 10:00 you only hear the Arch Bells.   The\", \"I stayed here for 5 nights. The hotel staff are really great! They are very warm, friendly and helpful. That compensates for other drawbacks of this hotel. The rooms are very cold, humid and dark. It's a bit over-priced.  Due to its ultra-high ceilings, the small electric heater is not very useful. So it's very cold at night.  The worst thing is the big clock right outside the gate that chimes every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day! Really annoying!  If you are not a sound sleeper, you should think twice before choosing this hotel.\", \"My rating: 2.5/5; I stayed in two hotels in Antigua, Hotel Euromaya and this one. Between the two, I would recommend Euromaya more. Just like Euromaya, Casa Antigua is very close to Antigua's center (Parque Centrale) so the location is convenient. In both hotels, the noise is a problem with the open-courtyard design and street traffic, but with Casa Antigua, there is some kind of bar/nightclub nearby so loud music is there aside from the expected noise of cars on cobblestone roads and people setting off firecrackers. I am not blaming the hotel for the noise, but as a light sleeper, it is information I would want others to know.  The room and bathroom were quite small but you can get by - for me the real annoyances were lack of space in the bathroom for even a few travel-sized\", 'Hotel Casa Antigua is in a good location only a block or so off the central park. We stayed in 3 different rooms during our stay. First was room 1 which was a beautiful room but a little noisy due to its close proximity to the front desk and the water and coffee station right next to it. The shower drain was pretty clogged so we asked for another room. Im not sure of our next room number but it was in a much quieter location  although much smaller and had a mildew smell. We put up with that for a few days and then took off to Monterrico. We came back to the hotel again for one more night and ended up in room 14. This was a beautiful room with a big bathroom and a good shower in a good location far away from the front desk.  Ok Mr. Complainalot, what next?

I honestly believe it was taken by a member of staff.  Rude staff.   Also they have birds in the middle of the hotel which are really loud and wake you up in the night.

This is a 45 minute ride.  This took nearly 2.5 hours because my shuttle drove around for over an hour to chat with friends and eventually pick up the last passenger to really pack the shuttle out.

I didn't lose anything but it made me very nervous!  2 stars because I got there in one piece....haha\", \"The reason I stayed there was because it's cheap. It's true that they only have one bathroom and there's birds that were very noisy. But I like the music that they played in the common area.

This is a hostel with one bathroom...one toilet and one shower in the same room. If someone is taking a 30-minute shower and you really need to pee, you're screwed. For some reason, even though the shower and toilet are together, the shower still reeks of piss. Also, they have birds that squawk incessantly through the afternoon, making it unbearable to hang around there.   My beef with them concerns the shuttle to San Salvador.

Front desk staff was extremely professional, courteous and helpful. Pretty, plant-filled central courtyard. Handy small kitchenette on the main floor if you are backpacking and/or like to prepare light meals. Amazing views from the roof-top patio-garden. Loved being up there. Definitely not child-safe or clumsy-safe as there are potted cacti everywhere and no railing around the edges. I take this to mean that they see their guests as competent adults.  We booked two 3rd floor rooms. It was quieter up there but the rooms were quite small. They were tidy but could have benefited from a fresh coat of paint.

Second there are 5 dogs who live there(i like dogs). Lastly you can book shuttle buses there.   However on the whole our stay here was a pretty negative one. Our first night was a Saturday. We were so tired from traveling but from 9pm - 2am there was exceptionally loud music from a club very nearby. Earplugs had no use and the music vibrated through the walls. Finally at 2am we got to sleep only to be woken up at 4am to a rooster next door.

I would recommend this to fellow travelers.', 'Very friendly and attentive staff.  They helped us with tips on things to see and do. The rooms were spotless.

If you don't, you may find it doesn't do it for you.  The party is meant to shut down at 10pm prompt to allow guests to sleep...some nights it did, other nights it went on for a lot longer and on one of those nights,when I went out to enquire, I saw that only the lone barman was there with no guests at all banging out the music.

The central fountain is beautiful and many of our group had pictures there.  The beds were comfortable and despite the comments about the bells, they did not bother me at all.  We had a room in the center courtyard and while it was a little dark, we spent little time in the room so it really did not matter.  This is a great hotel for the local flavor and the location is absolutely ideal, you simply cannot get lost as it is right by the arch.  If you want the Hyatt, do not stay here, if you want to feel like you are in Guatemala, then by all means choose this hotel.\", 'We have stayed at this Hostal multiple times whilst in Guatemala. The beds are really comfortable, water pressure is good and the free water a bonus. The wifi is patchy at times and shower often cold but overall great value for money. Speaking Spanish/ being great at charades a bonus!!', \"I thought I was having increased allergies because of the air in Antigua, and took 2 x the recommended amount of allergy medicine. Turns out it was the poor air quality at the hostel. I stayed another few weeks and was off all medication by the time I left. There's smoke always billowing through and the cleaning products are highly, highly scented and over used.  I tried several beds, they were all very well worn.  The staff was generally put out when asking for simple things, like having the TV work (Netflix works one out of 10 times and then you have to turn it up so loud because the staff have the music up so loud) I think I watched one show one time, and asked for help about 10 times  (and one time a friend had to use her own log in, and then the staff had to be asked\", 'During a day in Antigua we stopped by Posada to take a look.  Stayed for a couple of drinks.  Both the service and the place were very good, and it reflects the charm Antigua is known for.  Both Carlos and Hazel were great hosts.

When we arrived in Antigua we discovered the place we had originally planned to stay had lost our reservations and could no longer accommodate us.  Hotel Casa Antigua then agreed to take care of our group.   We were very pleased.  Our rooms were nice and clean.  We had WiFi and the location was excellent.  Our travelers could easily walk to the town center and all the shops and restaurants.  I am so grateful that Hotel Casa Antigua agreed to help us out.  If we ever return to Antigua, I would not hesitate to stay here again.  They are a good hotel and good to take care of groups that travel together.  Again, the location is excellent!', 'We paid $50 (US) for two basic dorm beds and were not provided towels- they wanted to charge us an extra $3 for two towels (on top of deposit). At the price we were paying this didn’t feel great. Also no kitchen, and not even a fridge to keep water or milk in (and no breakfast so it would be good to have a place to store milk for coffee/cereal). Otherwise a nice place with free filter water and tea, and a nice rooftop.', 'The food is great, the drinks are reasonable and there are often good deals on. Its a super sociable  place and so clean for a hostel! The wifi is strong and good.  They have a lot of fun games, our favourite was the giant jenga with forfeits on each block! The service was fab too - staff so friendly. I can imagine staying here would be a brilliant craic!', \"Enjoyed a second stay here on a return trip to Guatemala with a work team.  After a week in the mountains at a more rural hotel, this was a nice change of pace.  The architecture and interior are wonderful, with a peaceful interior open garden.  The location is handy to local shopping and dining, and the place seems to be secure.  The rooms themselves are a bit sparse, but comfortable and clean.  It's not the Ritz, but hey it's not South Beach either.\", \"Booked this place based on the reviews here and was not disappointed. The staff is amiable and the rooms are very clean. At $70 a night it is not a bargain basement deal you'd expect in a central america, but that is more a factor of Antigua being a popular place with tourists.  Rooms are extremely clean and the morning view of the smoking volcano from the rooftop is worth the stay alone.   Noise travels easily and beds are smallish.\", \"Posada La Merced was simple, but very clean and comfortable.  Who spends their vacation in their hotel room anyway?  It was a perfect place to lay my head in between days of getting out and enjoying Antigua.  Why pay more for a room you won't be spending much time in?  It can be a bit noisy if people come in late at night.  There is a rooftop with an awesome view.  The best part is it is right next to Fernando's Coffee Shop, and not far from the center of town and the market.\", \"DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.  My parents, friends and my husband and I all stayed here during Semana Santa. They charged $75 per room per night. This is a considerable amount of business for a small hotel like this.   We got into the room and found a filthy bathroom - dust, dirt and hair over EVERYTHING and a rusty shower that was sure to give you tetanus. But we said 'ok, we can deal with this, it's just a little bit of dust', and cleaned the bathrooms ourselves.   We went out and then came back around 10:00pm.  To our shock and horror, LOUD LOUD LOUD LOUD LOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUD HORRIBLE ROCK MUSIC STARTED BLARING INTO OUR ROOM.

However, I´m pretty sure the sheets on my bed had not been laundered since the previous inhabitant, and the shower mat was wet....ugh.', 'I spent one night in this lovely hotel in Antigua.  The room was lovely; the gardens in the in the interior of the hotel even lovelier.  Check in was a little more challenging than ideal since I arrived early, but not really a problem since everywhere I turned in Antigua there was even more to see.  The room was extremely quiet, fine for this exhausted traveler who desperately needed my rest.  The breakfast was adequate, although less than most buffets in Antigua.', 'The rooms are very large and the renovation has maintained many original features. The gardens and terrace create a calm ambience right in the middle of Antigua.I had walked by this hotel many times and had no idea of what a gem it is!', 'This small hotel has clean and quiet rooms and a terrific breakfast buffet. Excellent staff and great location in Antigua. Less expensive than other hotels on the street. A great option. Oh and the garden and terrace views are lovely.', 'And holy. Why oh why would they be serving Folgers coffee to us here at breakfast. This is Guatemala.  Some of the world best coffee. The hotel itself is gorgeous.  Nice staff. Our room is real nice but have to give lower rating as the morning started bad with horrible coffee.', 'We love this place. Good vibes, seems like fun, young (mainly Australian/American) backpackers are attracted to this spot. They have their own bar with good happy hour deals, frequent free shots. The downside is the are VERY STRICT about no outside drinks. They have a wristband policy for nighttime access (no booty calls). They have a nice pool with hammocks on the deck and apparently a new hot tub. At 70Q this is a tiny bit pricier than others in the area but I would recommend it for the vibe. Shout out to front desk Pati who is the mas chula!', \"We went there for a dinner with friends, we did not stay at the hotel. The dinner was fairly good. It is not a traditional Guatemala's food, it is more like stylish type of food (small portions) .

From the bathroom window we could enjoy the view of the lovely swimming pool. We enjoyed a nice dinner along the swimming pool and had the pleasure to meet the owner.

If we get the opportunity to come back, we will select one of them.', 'La Sin Ventura is 75 yards from the central plaza of Antigua.  Rooms are simple, neat, clean and offer hot showers.  There is an attached cinema and cafe. On the ground floor is a disco.  The disco is quiet after 10 PM. In the morning, the disco staff serve a continental breakfast.  I have found the reception staff to be very accommodating.  They provide shuttle service to and from Aurora, the international airport. Everything I need is a short walk from La Sin Ventura, and I have stayed there every year for the last five years.', 'There is one disco downstairs in the front and one next store. both are open and playing very loud music until 3am. we were not told about the disco when we checked in. Only when we arrived after dinner at 10pm, we heard the thumping music. it reverberates throughout the whole building. If you like to party all night it would be a great place to land and crash after drinking too much and dancing your tail off.  I had a 14 year old daughter. so when in Rome, do as the romans do, dance all night long. otherwise hotel was clean, rooms nice, tile in hallway pretty. wireless in the lobby. polite staff.', \"When you are young and you are there to party and don't have to sleep, it's fine. It's in a fantastic location. Next to Mono Loco. The bar downstairs is fun, loud, and with stiff drinks. There are bathrooms with the room.  The cons: loud, no a/c and there are windows that open into the hallway let in all the noise. And it is VERY noisy here because of the location between 2 very loud bars. A few of us got a rash from the sheets (maybe bedbugs?).  The showers are kind of dirty. I would still recommend it for young travelers, but not if you want to sleep at night.\", \"We stayed at this hotel for a few nights and were delighted by the wonderful customer service!  The front desk and cleaning staff were both accomdating and friendly.  The rooms were nice and clean, and the location excellent.  It did get loud on the first floor when the club downstairs was having a big night, but I imagine the noise doesn't carry through to the upper floors.\", 'This place gets my own rating of 1 or 2 on Friday and Saturday and a 4 any other day.   The price goes up on the weekend too; if anything it should be half price.   I stayed at this hotel on 3 visits to Antigua and the last visit (on a Friday and Saturday) I finally convinced myself not to return if I am visiting on the weekend.  Ear plugs and Ambien will barely overcome the noise of the disco.  Other than that, the descriptions outlined here are correct.  The location could not be any better.   It is a clean place, there is about 1” of space between your knees and the wall when sitting on the toilet, the shower is nice, forceful and hot and the single beds are for the most part comfortable.   The sole louvered windows into the hall seem to provide adequate ventilation but one', 'Hotel Casa Cristina is a short walk from everything. But then, so is everything in Antigua. Hotel is well run by incredibly friendly and helpful staff who speak both Spanish and English. Rooms are clean and well presented though small. Good hot water in the showers. The rooms are not at all sound-proof, so loud conversations can be heard and, if you get a downstairs room, the door bell you need to use to get into the hotel will annoy the hell out of you in the morning. The rooms on the higher floors are quieter. There is a roof top terrace with great views.', 'This hotel is very conveniently located right near the center of town. The staff is VERY helpful and friendly. The woman who served us breakfast was so sweet and was constantly smiling. Everyone who worked here seemed to really enjoy working there. We stayed one night, left town for about a week and return for one night. Upon our return, Leonardo, gave each one of us a big hug welcoming us back. The staff was helpful with booking transportation and setting up reservations for accommodations in places that were next on our itinerary. The room was very clean and spacious.

We would have complained, but the hotel was fully booked.

Fitness center was fine too, and seemingly nice spa which we never used..', \"We got a deluxe room as we'd make reservations only a day before and no others were available for the Saturday night before Palm Sunday. It was lovely -- decorated nicely, quiet, comfortable, ready hot water, etc..  Ours was steps from a lap pool but as pool hours are strictly enforced (9a.m. to 9p.m.) so it caused no problems. The room was wonderful and had a fireplace (I need to come back on a cool night just to have a fire - that would be a treat).The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood a few short blocks from a main plaza. Ask for a room off the main street if you want real peace as trucks and occasionally a car alarm could be heard.

My husband and I stayed at the Convento a total of five nights in two rooms in the old section of the hotel because we left for three nights to go to Lake Atitlan.   Considering that this part of the hotel was constructed in the 1600s, it was as I expected.  If we had expected to find a Marriott-like room, we would have rated this differently.  Yes, there is a little noise at night from the dining area overlooking the courtyard, but that did not continue too late; yes, the basic structure of the room is old and not perfect or plastic.  The rooms are huge with high ceilings and interesting tile work.  We were comfortable; no insects; the staff was excellent; breakfast is included in the price', 'We stayed (thankfully) one night in this hotel, and I would not recommend it to anyone.  We stayed in the new annex, and if your taste runs to crummy, ratty, semi-clean motel rooms with no charm or character at all, this is the place for you.  An added bonus is the disco next door that pounds until 1 a.m., and the rooster directly behind the wall that starts up at 4 a.m.  No extra charge for those.  The central location beneath the arch is great if you like fraternity parties going on in the street at all hours of the weekend.  Seriously, stay someplace else.  I certainly would.', 'I stayed with my wife last August a couple of days and we loved it.

She contacted the manager (the most rude person I have ever encounter in any customer service facing job) that after shouting at the housekeepers for not having clean linen in the room, decided that we could have our money back and leave (there was another couple at the reception looking for a room so while we were still there they checked them In into our room, gave us the money (in cash) and send us away.

It is quiet and safe. Except the noise from the next room, staffs are all kind and polite; the breakfast was also delicious. Because of those factors, 4 of us decided to stay one more night.

Our first night was in room 10 (double bed) and everything was great!  The room was small but it was comfortable and the shower was great.  The hotel was a block from Central Park and close to all the major sites.  The second night was in room 12 (double+single bed) and the water pressure for the shower was horrible so make sure you ask about the water pressure when you pick a room.  The only compliant I have is the loud noise at night from a nearby bar.  The hotel had a note saying there may be loud noises on weekends but we were there on Tuesday and Thursday and there was loud music until 12/1am.  Also, if you book online, they charge you about $10 more, so it's better to call/email to make your reservation.\", 'Two of our party of five saw the Eterna Primavera hotel & restaurant while walking.  They were impressed by the beauty of the place and we all returned for a lunch. We were all impressed with the decor and the care with which  some parts of this very old building were preserved. The garden area was beautiful and worthy of many pictures. The atmosphere was lovely and relaxed and not too noisy. We enjoyed ourselves in the nice surroundings. The  staff was friendly and attentive. Be aware that Eterna Primavera lacks a liquor license, if that is important to you. The menu was limited but the food was nice. Afterwards they showed us one of the rooms.

The bar, pool, food, lounging are all great.  The place is really neat.  The beds and rooms were clean.  However, the bathrooms were filthy.  The bath/shower on the main level was gag worthy.  No paper, always some sort of fluid on the floor.  The bathrooms upstairs were a bit better, but were out of paper as well.  Also worth noting, The only trouble I had booking a shuttle happened here.  The 4:30 AM shuttle for the airport never showed.  The overnight security was able to get a shuttle for me, in just enough time to make my flight.  If they maintained the bathrooms, this would be a top hostel in Antigua.', \"The good things : the staff, the pool, like the other reviews like to repeat. Granted.  Needing a good night's sleep and having trouble finding something last minute, I stayed here as more out of necessity than want, understanding that it had a bit of reputation as a party but other wise nice hostel. I've stayed in hundreds of hostels and with my trusty earplugs I'll sleep through any kind of noise. It wasn't to be the noise that prevented me from getting NOT ONE HOUR of sleep in this place; it goes down as one of my top 5 worst stays I've had in hostels.  I checked in and went to my 8-bed dorm.

My bed was very comfortable and for a private room with private bath, the place was very affordable.

It's a great spot to have breakfast and look out at the volcano, not so great if you're trying to sleep past 5:30am, which is when the staff start setting up for breakfast up there.

Pretty old world style with lovely public spaces. Beautiful fountains. Antigua can be quite expensive, so this is a good value hotel. Excellent location near the central square. Rooms are small.

The rooftop terrace was a great spot to take in city views and greet the day with a cup of coffee. I was able to arrange the hike of Pacaya volcano and transportation to Lago de Antitlan with the front desk.

The staff was very friendly and helpful with directions and suggestions for attractions in Antigua.

I stayed in a triple room that had two beds on one side, a bathroom in the middle and one bed on the other side.  It was spacious, clean and comfortable.  The windows are glass slats so they don't do much to drown out the sounds of other guests, but with ear plugs I was able to have a great night sleep.

Breakfast was very adequate but not mouth-watering and the breakfast room can appear a little subdued. However, the hotel overall is highly characterful and in the old style with nice roof terraces overlooking the town.

I asked for an espresso because the coffee I was served was barely drinkable. The replacement was good & was made from freshly ground beans.

The rooms are very small, bed, closet, one hard wood chair and that's all. There is no room to move about, no screens on the one window so mosquitoes was a problem.

The service was also great for the most part, but I did have a problem with one of the volunteer workers who was immature, rude and very temperamental, but I'm not sure if he's still there.  My only gripe really is that there wasn't really much going on at this hostel. There was only 2 or 3 other people staying there while I was and I found it pretty hard to find any reason to hang around for too long.

The room was a nice large size, and the wifi worked well inside the rooms. Our only complaint was that there was massive street construction going on outside the hotel (obviously not their fault), however this caused us to not have water consistently at the hotel for two days. This cannot be helped, I understand that, however normally on booking websites, if there is construction that may alter the services of the hotel, it is normally mentioned, to ensure you have all the details before you arrive.', \"i enjoyed my stay at Hostal Las Marias.  The people there are very nice and accommodating.  The rooms are very comfortable with good beds.

I will return to Las Marias in the future...thank you Xiomara and Santiago!...\", 'Antigua has a lot of charm, and staying at Hostal Las Marias added to that charm for us during our stay in late February. The service, suite, and breakfast were all wonderful. The only thing I would have preferred was if the location was just a bit closer to the city center. Walking home at night was fine two people, but I would have avoided it if I were alone.', \"I've spent three nights here from the 7th till the 9th of August. The hostal arranged for us the pick up from the Guatemala City Airport at a very convenient price. As soon as we arrived at Las Marias, a really nice guy welcomed us giving tones of useful information about Antigua. He also booked for us the Pacaya Volcano tour on a horse (fantastic experience btw!) and he woke up that morning at 5 just to prepare us breakfast, it was so nice of him! For breakfast you can choose between a continental one with toasts and marmelade or a local one with eggs and frijoles which is a typical guatemalan dish made of beans (really good!).

The rooms are basic and could do with a bit of colour, but great for the price. We noticed a very bad drain smell on the ground floor, but thankfully we were upstairs and there was no smell.

The real benefit of this hotel is the great location- everything is within an easy walk, which makes exploring the beautiful streets of Antigua even more enjoyable!', \"We stayed here on two different occasions both equally nice. Rosario helped us out with great recommendations on where to go on a budget and with only a little time to experience Antigua. If you are not on a budget definitely splurge for a room on the top floor!

If you plan on hanging around in a hostel then there are far better options. I stayed in a room with 3 beds and no private bathroom. The room was very small and there was only one electric socket in it.  Needless to say the staff is very friendly and the location is above average, even after considering the price.

However we were so glad as this hostel at a cheap rate of 100Q per double room was perfect for us. What was funny was that it was actually in the travel guide we had with us, we just hadn't registered! The rooms are basic, but clean and to be honest absolutely fine for what we wanted. The wifi is quick and there is a lovely little communal area in the courtyard or a table in the kitchen where everyone congregates. There is free coffee/tea provided all day which is a great little bonus and there is someone on duty at the front desk 24/7 so it's very safe.

However despite this is wasn't for me.   If you tend to oversleep, Mochilero would be perfect for you. The super thin walls mean that even a whisper in a neighbouring room or across the hostel will keep you awake. Also, there is a constant ringing (I think it must come from the plumbing) that will bring back fond memories of your first loud concert.   If you are a calorie counter, Mochilero will probably also appeal to you.

Whereas all other hotels allowed us and wanted us to pay at check-out, this hotel demanded we pay the hotel bill in full within an hour on arrival or incur a 10% surcharge on our credit card which they stated they would run through.

The grounds are beautiful, the pool nicely heated, and the public facilities are all in the Antigua colonial style.  The location is excellent -- three blocks from the main square.  There are, however, two issues that prevent me from giving the hotel an overall excellent rating.  First, the rooms are quite small.  This would be ok were it not for the fact that a whole row of rooms back onto a very busy street. The traffic noise from large trucks rumbling by at all hours of the night could keep a light sleeper awake.   These rooms, of course, are the less expensive rooms, and if you're willing to shell out more the problem goes away.

The ceiling fan worked intermittently, although the maintenance man quickly came when called to reset it to make it work.

It was just awesome to go through the villages by scooter and get a taste of the true Guatemala, outside the touristy spots.

The hostel is a former family house with the typical central patio to bring fresh air to the rooms however my room had a particular smell and I must admit was not pleasant at all and the tiny windows did not helped much. The floor was dusty due to the renovations and I never saw someone cleaning the common areas either.

Drinking water, tea and coffee are always available.  The rooftop terrace is very pleasant and gave me a chance to get oriented when I first arrived in Antigua.

Pleasant hotel and would recommend.', 'I stayed here with a large group, and found the facilities to be adequate, and the staff exemplary.  The large suite on the top floor would be perfect for a small family or a group of friends.  There is a shared kitchen, which keeps costs down, and--maybe because I stayed with so many people I already knew--the whole place has a sort of \"international slumber party\" vibe that is really comforting and warm.   The front desk staff are helpful, knowledgeable, and committed to making sure you get the experience you want in Antigua.', \"The front desk staff earns a 5 star rating for their professionalism and helpfulness. The hotel is lovely with it's indoor courtyards.  It is located far enough from the noise to provide a quite night's sleep but close enough that we could walk to the central park area.  Our room was comfortable but very small.  This, along with no hot water in the shower earns the 3 stars.  I doubt the lack of hot water is  a normal occurrence but it was an inconvenience which  we did not have time to deal with on our last morning in Antigua.  If you do stay here, check the hot water when you check in so that you are not inconvenienced in the morning.  I do recommend breakfast at the cafe/coffee shop next door to the hotel.

My room was comfortable, the staff was friendly; helpful; and welcoming, and the location was convenient to the center of town.

It felt like we were sleeping on the street.  It was very dingy, and I wished I had known The Yellow House was across the street at the time.

After hiking the Acatenango vulcano we really wanted a hot shower! Besides that, the bed in the tent was not long enough for my boyfriend (1.94m) and this information was not available online beforehand.

I don't recommend it given its hard to get to, the service staff (this one in particular) was rude and everything after doesn't seem worth it. We left 20 minutes after we checked in and don't care too many for the refund. I would rather stay at a rat infested hotel than deal with bad behavior.\", 'Mary, Rosy and Susy were amazing.

On the 6th March we had an email saying because of Semana Santa we could either cancel or pay a hike to 450Q ($61*). That's an 87.5% increase... By this time any value rooms were gone so we had little choice.  Raised this with management on arrival (who admitted they did this to everyone who booked in advance for this period) to give them a chance to change their minds.

The kitchen is not the best, 2 ring hob and no workspace and hardly any utensils so if you want to cook up a big meal its not great.I think they rely on people ordering at their cafe which does really decent breakfasts and lunchs though and plenty of food options around the town.

Had to go down in my pijamas at 6AM to talk to the hotel staff to complain about the noise.   They said they were sorry but did not do anything at all.

Also, we appreciated the large fluffy towels, comfortable beds, modern, spacious bathrooms, and friendly, helpful reception.

It might be a bit expensive compared to other hotels in the area, but the service, rooms and breakfast quality is definitely superior. We were unlucky enough to stay in the rooms at the back where during the weekends it is impossible to sleep because of the loud noise coming from the disco-bar right next to it. At the reception, they told us they were trying to do something about it. Besides that annoying detail, the stay was perfect. Breakfast (buffet) is not included in the price, but I highly recommend it!! I also recommend to enjoy a beer in one of their beautiful terraces.

Our junior suite (Room 10) was at the back of the hotel with no view at all other than a wall but was quiet, spacious, beautifully furnished and with probably the most comfortable bed we slept in all holiday.

There are three rooms with queen beds: rooms 4, 5, 6.  We stayed in room 5, a very small room with no outside window and no lamps for bedside reading.  If $80 is your limit for a double room for two people and climbing over each other to get into bed would annoy you, I urge you to go elsewhere or otherwise spend $20 more and book one of the very spacious $100 rooms with two queen beds.  Others have noted a musty smell.  We found this to be true for our room, and the smell did not disappear even after the staff brought in a fan and dehumidifier.  The smell was sufficiently annoying and the room much too cramped, so we left after two days and found\", \"There is no doubt: it's a good value for money.

We found that if your spanish isn't at least serviceable, you could find yourself frustrated and lost in a hurry.  At Meson, while the location is impeccable, the restaurant food is high quality, delicious, and affordable, the service (like turn down, etc.. ) is up to par.  However, we felt like the hotel patrons are guests to\", 'We decided to stay at Los Pasos for 3 nights, before and after our big trek up Acatenango (Feb 2017). Such a lovely courtyard setting and everyone was helpful getting us into our room early and making sure we were comfortable. Breakfast was really great and included in the price. Quaint, friendly and not pretentious was just perfect for us. Most people can easily walk anywhere in Antigua so location was good, approx 10 short blocks to the main square. We also felt secure enough to leave our luggage with them while we climbed. After our climb we had a glorious day full of room service to recover. Would definitely stay again and we will definitely be back to Antigua. We LOVED Guatemala!', 'I honestly have no idea how this hotel gets such good reviews . We booked a room at Los Pasos for two nights and I decided to pay extra to upgrade to a “junior suite” as a treat. I sent requests before we arrived for a quiet room at the back with one queen bed rather than two doubles (which is what I’d booked anyway) . When we arrived we were shown to room 10. Whilst it was pretty, it was absolutely tiny and did not offer the facilities promised on the junior suite description. I looked online to double check and the exact picture of the room we were given was pictured on the internet as a standard room. We questioned this and were told it was a junior suite. It clearly was not as it couldn’t have been a simpler or smaller room. I pointed out that the room we had been given was', 'Lovely, colonial/hacienda style place with interior garden; unheated pool and terrific onsite sauna. Staffing is only during the day; most needs are met by the adjacent (and far pricier) sister hotel Meson Panza Verde, which is where the terrific breakfast is served by a roaring fire. ', 'The hotel is a series of spaceous rooms around a lovely garden.  We had room number 2 at the left hand side of the entrance gate (you need to ring, and somebody comes to open the gate for you, so it´s very safe and separate from the \"outside world\") and had only some noise on Saturday evening, when a wedding party took place in the Capuchinas ruins across the street. Beds are comfortable and huge (most of the double beds in Guatemala are really wide singles, the double beds here are like twice the width of the former). Breakfast is included and was very good quality.

The Guest House - I would not call it a Hotel - was full of character and the garden is pleasant but the service is bad - no English is spoken - and the rooms are very noisy - there are iron works nearby and the hammering starts very early in the morning.   We discovered ants or wild-life of some sort  (I was assured they were NOT bed bugs because we could see them) in our bed and on our mattress  and when we drew attention to this the matter was very badly handled by the manager.  I could not recommend this place.', 'We stayed in La Llorona room which was approximately 16\\' x 16\\' with 2 small chairs and a small table between them.   We had two very comfortable queen beds and pillows, a flat panel t.v., a fireplace, a small night stand between the beds with lamp, an overhead chandelier, one luggage rack, tile floor.   There was a small alcove with the closet that had two shelves, a small hanging area, one drawer and a safe.     No additional amenities were provided other than carmel candies that were very good!

Breakfast was nice and fresh. Normally only from 7:30am, however on three occasions we told them the man at the desk that we had a trip leaving at 6am and he was kind enough to personally get up early to put breakfast out at 5:30am for us! The location is good and not so good depending on what you want. It is a 5 minute walk from the centre of the town, but that also means that you don’t get [incredibly loud] chicken buses, beeping horns etc at 5-6am.

Great common area and awesome patio.', \"Great clean hostel with lovely deck.   Owner speaks great English and are very friendly. Food is good but don't book a massage. Very expensive and not worth it.   Dorms were comfortable and the single rooms are good too. Showers hot and atmosphere good. \", 'This is a pretty and clean place to stay with fairly large rooms and a beautiful courtyard and rooftop terrace. Our issue was that it seemed the owner wants this place to be the fun, party, hangout for young backpackers (good drink specials, loud music ALL DAY that is easily heard from inside the rooms) but the price and quality is geared to people with a budget slightly above backpackers. It was a little odd in the afternoons as loud music was blaring but there was absolutely no one eating or drinking in the courtyard. I think if the owner focussed on making it slightly above backpackers at the late 20s, early 30s crowd I think it would be awesome. But like I said, we felt as though the owner wants it to be a party place for backpackers so the identity crisis hurts this place.', 'it is in a great and quite safe location, nice staff, clean room and big and clan common kitchen. We recommend it!', 'Darryl Hicks, the hotel owner, was very helpful and friendly as were his staff members -- especially Angelica & Rosie.   I Emailed Rosie and requested a sunny room.  I got my request with #10. It was bright and roomy with a large window and wrought iron decorative cover and very neat inside shutters. There was a huge floor to ceiling rustic cabinet which could hold everything you had and much more.  It also had a very nice, new tiled bath which was immaculate.  It overlooked the tile roof of the main building and the mountains beyond - a very nice view while relaxing in bed.  The Central Park and Central Market were very short walks.  The desk arranged shuttle service to many othe places.  Prices were a little cheaper around town, but the hotel service was very convenient.  The', \"This place is awful. I have travelled the world, stayed in hostels in Africa, Europe, South America, and backpacked through Alaska and I have never had such an awful all-around experience as I had here. First, let me say in booking this hotel (which is little more than a hostel), I read reviews on this and other travel websites. I looked at Rustica's website, emailed the front desk and asked lots of questions prior to my arrival. I took time to do my research.  They still were able to pull the wool over my eyes. To start off, we arrived and were told that if paying by credit card, we would be charged an additional fee of 12%. Well, no big deal except for the simple fact that this was never disclosed up front. Not on the website, not via multiple emails, never until arrival.\", 'We stayed at Posada la merced and had a lovely time.

The only problem was, the rooms are in an open courtyard and voices outside the rooms are VERY loud.

Moreover she prepares delicious breakfast too :) Guys who works there with her are also very nice. Mario helped a lot to my friend who had her phone broken, he took her to service and helped with translations etc. Amazing attitude of those Guys :) There is awesome famous(when you read opinions) tarrace with breath taking volcano view :) Don't look for anything else guys, just take it if it's still available :)\", 'Stunning location, so magical to wake up to unbelievable views in your own little sanctuary. This place has so much potential, unfortunately the staff were a slight let down.   On arrival we didn’t get the warm welcome we were expecting. It is apparent that there is so much going on here - yoga, massage, sauna, the farm, group meals - We would have loved some enthusiasm about all they have to offer, to have been given a tour, or even be shown to our rooms. When asking for information or ordering food/drinks we felt like we were disturbing the staff.   So much time and effort has gone in to making this place the ideal destination for yogis and people who want to escape the hustle and bustle of Antigua and with just a slight change in attitude from the staff this could be perfect.', 'I have been very pleased with my stay at Camino de Santiago.

The hotel is only 5 min walk from downtown Antigua. Breakfast was good.', \"I've stayed in many hotels in Antigua over the last 10 years, and I really dislike this one. It is a mid-range hotel, not a budget hotel. In Antigua this means you should get at least nice linens and towels, higher quality complimentary toilet items, and better service. However, here the quality is similar to what you would get at a hotel half the price with a bit of looking. The courtyard and plants are really lovely, but the same attention to detail does not extend to the rooms. Noise levels, especially on the weekends, are absolutely unbearable. Overall, at this hotel you get the feeling that corners are being cut and that you are getting less then you are paying for. There are several other hotels in town in the same price range where the reverse is true.\", 'Although this is a hotel, we only visited the restaurant. It has a very nice courtyard and off the beaten path. The food is excellent and the presentation beautiful, but be prepared to wait at least one hour for your food.

When you are assigned a room check it out thoroughly to make sure everything is functioning as it should. One room given to our group was uninhabitable due to a very strong sewer odor. The staff is friendly. The center courtyard is comfortable. One of the best features is the rooftop where breakfast is served. The menu is actually very good.

The design of the rooms is beautiful and the hotel is very quiet since it only has 5 rooms. It's like renting a house in Antigua. The beds and the bathroom are quite comfortable, although in the room there was a little humid, it was not a problem. At night you could hear something walking on the roof, I suppose it was some nocturnal animal, but after the first night, it was not a problem to sleep. I definitely recommend the Palo Santo Hotel to stay in La Antigua.\", 'Awesome little boutique property in the heart of Antigua, just a few blocks from the main square and all restaurants and shops.

Evelyn, the manager, was very personable and helpful with tips and recommendations. My only one disclaimer, make sure you get the room that you booked (or wanted)!

I was just lucky it was a crying baby and her parents trying to console her, and not a honeymooning couple, that I was listening to. I asked to be switched to another room, but no others were available. When I made the reservation, I had specifically asked for a quiet room, but maybe all of the rooms have thin walls.

This is due to one bathroom on the first floor serving around 20 guests.  A cleaner does come in but not everyday.  When you enter the reception there is a guy (part owner he told me), lying asleep on the sofa, to be honest he is lying there most of the day and night.  He has his own private room but never uses it. He also like to drink and ramble on and moan about how much he has to do. not very much from what i could see.

They sell snacks at the front desk, arrange tours for you, and have internet pretty cheap (although not as cheap as in town), but best of all, the location is just one block off the main plaza.    The reason I only give it 3 stars is because we had a fairly dark, stuffy room.  It was clean, but the bathroom was one of those that isn't really a room.  You know, where the walls don't exactly reach the ceiling, and the door isn't in a frame or anything.

Excellent for couples, business or just pleasure. I will be back with my husband and friends. The praises are reasonable and can walk to the most tourist spots in Antigua. ', 'This is an older hotel that has been well cared for and beautifully renovated to provide a clean and comfortable accommodation. The bedding is modern as are the bathrooms. There is both hot and cold running water. I was not impressed by the hotel restaurant. I only ate breakfast there, but found it lacking. The hotel does a good job providing security and locking the doors and gates at night. Security personnel are always visible and available for buzzer entry after hours. The best amenity that the hotel offers is an excellent location that is central to most everything in old downtown Antigua. This is a nice hotel that delivers a good value.  ', 'Good location in Antigua, met some great people and had good conversations in the courtyard. Clean and safe accommodations, responsive and friendly multilingual staff. Found on a recommendation from a year-round resident.', 'We stayed in Hotel Aurora for 2 nights. The hotel is nice and has a lovely garden. The sitting forniture outside the room are very comfortable. The room are spacious and essential. Bathroom size is OK and functional. Breakfast although basic is sufficient and the biscuits available are very good. Staff is nice and courteous. Perhaps the room are slightly overpriced but overall this hotel is a safe bet.', 'I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel.  The staff was very nice and the hotel decoration and location was very good.  I really recommend this hotel because it has a good value for money valuation. The only thing that they need to work for is the proximity of the parking lot.', 'D’Leyenda is a great find for visitors to Antigua seeking lovely accommodations and a notably central location at a very reasonable price.  With only 6 rooms, this hotel can experience noteworthy demand, so if you have your heart set on staying here, you might have to be flexible.  Why?  Well, for starters, the hotel might just have the best location in Antigua--if you were any closer to the central Plaza, you’d be sleeping on the steps of the Cathedral.  D’Leyenda is just a half block from northeast corner of the very center of this colonial city, on the same side of the street from the iconic Cathedral.    The staff is wonderful, helpful, detail-oriented--even after I checked out, the front desk manager greeted me by name when I saw him while walking through Antigua.  You are', \"The hostel is located close to central park and withing easy walking distance of the market and chicken buses. They can arrange for some activities and the prices are comparable or a dollar or 2 cheaper than the travel places around the area. Rooms and bathrooms are VERY clean, and it was the first place I've stayed during my month in Guatamala where I didn't get hypothermia during a shower. The first time the water was tolerable, and when I mentioned it Carlos explained the trick to getting the water hot in the electric shower.  The breakfast was good for the price, but they were in the process of making a new menu and let me order a few things off it even though it wasn't official yet. They also have fantastic happy hour where you can order beer, certain mixed drinks, or shots\", \"We had just breakfast there. The owner was really really pushing to sell us the breakfast....  When we received our breakfast the portioning was really small and they OVER CHARGED US! Just for a tiny bit of extra guacamole they charged us 10Q and same for an extra couple of slices of bread!!! Plus as soon as we ordered the owner stopped being so nice but kind of rude..... We didn't enjoy the experience!\", 'Great hotel in Antigua. The location is central and in a great walking area. Hotel was quiet and relaxing, with big, comfortable beds. The staff was extremely helpful and accomodating and helped us schedule a trip to Pacaya at the last minute, via phone. Good value for the price, and I would definitely return.', \"We stayed two nights in this great little hotel. It's located only a few minutes' walk from Iglesia La Merced and the arch, maybe 10 minutes to Parque Central. The rooms don't have AC, which I thought might be a problem, but even in late May it is cool enough at night that you don't need it (it can be a little warm during the day, but you didn't come to Antigua to sit in your room, did you?) The rooftop terrace was a great spot to sit with some rum and a cigar--our first night there we watched a great lightning storm around the volcano. The small staff is extremely friendly and helpful.\", \"A friend and I decided, very last minute, to backpack through Guatemala. Antigua was the first stop on our trip. Casa Cristina was comfortable and felt safe. The halways are beautifully decorated and there are plants everywhere. The rooftop patio is absolutely perfect with a great view of the city and volcanos.   The water is heated at the shower head, isn't great but not bad either. The room we had was very simple but we weren't spending any time in there so it was perfect for our needs.\", \"Hotel Casa Cristina was perfect for our trip to Antigua, and you can't beat the price.  The hotel is located near the city center, so restaurants, shopping, the markets, banks are all just a quick walk away.  The owner, Rosario, was on site and helped us organize trips to the Volcano Pacaya and Semuc Champey.  Rosario was very trustworthy vs some of the other hotels and tour group operators that we came across that just wanted our money.  I will defiantly be going back to Hotel Casa Cristina on my next trip to Antigua.\", 'The staff did not know how/try to deal with the noisy drunk teenager guest crowd, too noisy until way past 1 AM, and regularly leaving the common kitchen in an impossible state to be used. Nicely they refunded me the last 3 days and I moved on to one the tens of “normal” hostel for a similar price. 3 toilets and 2 showers too few for such a large hostel. The reception lady is very nice', \"I stayed here in July 2007 while attending Spanish school.  I got a reduced rate since I stayed for more than a week.  As a frequent traveler to Guatemala, and fairly self-sufficient, I needed little help, but what I asked for I received ably and promptly.  My room was a bit smaller than I'd anticipated, but the bed was good, the water was hot, and the cable worked.  The place next door does get loud on weekend nights, but other than it wasn't a problem.  But that also had to do with the hotel's central location, which is a big attraction.  There are quieter places, but you'd either be spending more or be further from the park, or both.\", 'We had a mixed stay at Casa Rustica.  There\\'s an incredibly loud disco next door, which played music into the wee hours on weekend nights.  We also woke to early morning karaoke (\"Little Drummer Boy\", ranchera style, this being Christmastime) twice.  If you\\'re part of the Antigua party crowd, this may be a bonus, but we were a family doing early morning language study, so. .. not so much.  On the positive side:  incredibly clean, nice patio on one room (if you\\'re so lucky), the kids kicked a soccer ball on the upper patio and enjoyed the pool table.  Location is great -- in the middle of the action, but just know that means lots of party noise.  They do lock the front entrance early in the evening, so it feels pretty secure.  On the negative:  we actually had twelve people', 'The \"hostel\" (Much better than that) has a beautiful center garden, fully packed with wallflowers and a fountain. Around this garden, you will have the rooms, I think there are 7-8 rooms. Regarding the roooms, they are confy & small but warm environment. By the morning you will have the typical breakfast. Scrambed eggs and local read beans. Very good price-value relation.  A nice place to sleep for a couple of nights.', \"Ahh so nice and luxurious. Our first nights f vacation and were not disappointed. Delivers on all fronts. Can't really say anything negative about this place. The location is absolutely fine and really quiet area, no roosters, dogs barking here!\", \"On our first trip ever to Guatemala, my wife & I stayed here based upon the advice of other family members who'd stayed here before, having had a pleasant experience with Casa Capuchinas.  The general appearance of the place was rustic as expected, but well accommodated our needs. The room we had (I believe it was Room #1, and I highly recommend it), was a second floor unit at the front of the walled compound. Having only an empty unit below us, we only had to deal with noises from the street outside, which was minimal at best (They told us we could have switched rooms at any time if it were a problem). In fact, the only time when noise was ever an issue was when the old convent across the street had been rented out for a party for a night, and music blasted our eardrums well\", \"My wife and I spent 4 nights at Casa Capuchinas to attend a friend's pre-wedding celebration and wedding.  The outside of Casa Capuchinas, like a lot of things in Antigua, was quite unimpressive.  Once you walked in however, you enter a new world of a well  manicured central garden, places to sit and enjoy the outside and/or breakfast (included in the price) surrounded by individual rooms.  The location of Casa Capuchinas was right across one of the many church ruins (Capuchinas) which one could tour and was several blocks away from the central plaza of Antigua - a bit of a walk but reasonable.  A male attendant (we were initially greeted by Luis) is often present watching over the grounds and tending to guests.  Breakfast included eggs made as desired with or without tomatoes\", \"I moved to Casa Antigua after another hotel had proved to be 'a problem' and I was delighted to be welcomed to such a nice place.  This is not a fancy place but my room and bath were clean and comfortable and simply decorated. The gardens are beautiful, and it is great to come back from exploring the city and to sit outside and read and rest in a cool, quiet place..  Also, it is next door to a nice restaurant where you can have lunch or dinner without wandering the city.The breakfast at the hotel is a fantastic value (you do have to pay a modest amount for it).  They will bring you more food than you imagine! Freshly cooked eggs, nice fruit, etc.  Great coffee, too!  (Well, it is Guatemala, right?) I really liked this place and I would come here again.\", \"Had a really good 4 day stay at this charming hotel!  Felt like Lawrence of Arabia for 4 nights! Very near all the attractions of Antigua but it's so easy to become disorientated as you walk along the cobbled roads!  Very good value and the rooms were huge with high ceilings.  We stayed on the ground floor.  All the major attractions were within walking distance.  You'll get used to the city allay out after a day!! It's lovely walk to and from the hotel to the centre in all directions as you soak in the 18th century colonial  architecture on either side of the road as if time stood still!! Toiletries, water and the like were provided daily and all to a high standard.  I'd recommend this hotel if staying in Antigua!\", 'Good hotel with friendly staff and good English speaking receptionists, has a great rooftop view. The rooms had comfy beds, and after we came back after a day in Antigua there would always be fresh toiletries, bottled water and towels waiting in the room.  Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a hotel in Antigua ', 'Very nice hotel in the heart of Antigua. Elegant rooms nicely decorated with super soft matress, spacious and clean. Reception employees with good english, eager to help and provide directions We loved the terrace where we had breakfast every day. The view from up there is fantastic.  Value for money', \"A quiet and smartly located hotel that feels like a guest house. A few blocks from the main square. Friendly and warm service who offer breakfast and perhaps the best hotel restaurant I've ever experienced. Try the fresh seafood pasta with squid ink. It is delicious! European feel with waiters at every turn. Beautiful setting near garden courtyard and water feature. The hotel also houses and art gallery and offers yoga throughout the week. Views from the rooftop terrace provide a tranquil setting. \", \"I must admit to starting my Meson Panza Verde stay with a problem. This is a small colonial style property with one of Guatemala's best restaurants on the ground floor and beautiful guest rooms up above. On my first night here the two were not compatible. I arrived after a 15 hour journey from London and wanted to sleep. There is live music in the restaurant at weekends and I just couldn't get to sleep. There was bland Cuban Jazz plus drum machine thumping through the floor.  Once I overcame my jet lag, things got a lot better. Almost with a house party atmosphere, I could eat late in the restaurant then sleep late upstairs. The food in the restaurant is excellent and the rooms are a wonder to behold. The bathrooms alone are about the size of some London flats. The hotel treated\", 'Spectacular Antigua restaurant, with beautiful decorations and a very “antiguan” environment.  High quality international dishes.  In my opinion, the best restaurant in Antigua.  Ask for a table in the corridor surrounding the garden.  Reservations recommended for dinner.', \"I stayed here for three nights, the rooms are very small and I had to sit at and angle of the toilet because my knees touched the wall (I'm 5,5). However it was very clean and beautiful, the staff were lovely. I mentioned ironed I needed a doctor or pharmacy and the next day they checked that I was feeling better and if they could do anything for me. It was a very pleasant stay and I would reccomend it for the location and staff. You're just a short walk from loads of restaurants and bars.\", \"Room was pretty small and lacked any useable storage space. The bathroom was tiny and when seated on the loo your knees touch the wall! The fountain in the courtyard can be annoying and there were occasional drops in the water supply. But the location is great and the value is good and Jose (who I think may be the owner's son) is incredibly helpful and friendly and will go out of his way to make sure you get the most out of your visit.\", 'I think average is fair to describe this hotel. It is clean, relatively quiet and close to the city centre. But the staff do not speak english (as is listed) and the rooms and beds are tiny. At 6\\'1\" my feet were hanging off the end of the bed and it was impossible to sit on the toilet because the wall is so close. Even my little 5\\'5\" wife needed to sit sideways. It is nice that they provide free filtered water in the common area. In the room, half of the plug sockets were not working and the light switch needed a few presses before the light stayed on.  We left Antigua and returned a few days later and decided to stay elsewhere. I feel this was the right choice for us. The second place was the same price, but much nicer.', \"The place is nice. Location is great. Service is excellent. Clean.  Very helpful staff, providing us all what we needed or asked for.  There is no breakfast included but there is free coffee, filtered water, refrigerator, microwave,  toaster....  The only thing we didn't enjoy is that rooms and toilet are too small, almost no space for luggage.   Price is fair for Antigua. \", 'This hotel is very nice.  The rooms are very well appointed, there is no AC but the temperature when we stayed is quite comfortable.  The courtyard is quite charming.  The restaurant is good and the staff are even better.  The place is a close walk to the main shopping area of Antigua and the many churches around.  It has maintained its colonial charm.  Would go back to this one!', 'Beautiful grounds and courtyard. Superior king room:  super comfy bed with great linens, TV has 2 English news channels, Wi-Fi spotty, limited breakfast menu for what is included with room, larger for pay menu, very small room. The room was in a hallway which had a window that opened to a hallway. The help were very loud in hall way too early in the morning. Great location. Bathroom was ok, but the sink had no counter space. Would not stay here again. Too expensive for what you get. Sorry. Would like to be more positive.

There isn't an iron in the room, but you can call front desk and they will bring it to your room.\", \"I was travelling alone and when I first arrived, my taxi driver was unable to find this posada - it's a little out of the way, near the bus terminal. It took a lot of phone calls to locate it. Also, I have some mobility issues and found the four long blocks (1 km) to be challenging and regretted I hadn't chosen one of the many posadas closer to the Centro.   Because I had a single, I stayed on the main floor and found the room to be tiny but adequate. The noise from the buses and the streets was quite loud and woke me every morning but that could have been because I was on the main floor.   Breakfast was very good and the lady that served me was a delight.  The only person who spoke good English worked the day shift so I waited to talk to her to get information - what to see,\", 'The housing, bathrooms, grounds are clean and beautiful.

Good price for a tranquil setting with good service. The beds are pretty hard though. Solid 4 for Antigua. Breakfast was a solid 4- nothing imagined here.... the straight forward stuff. Quick service. ', 'Pros: (1) the friendly, helpful, and English-speaking staff, (2) conveniently located near Parque Central, restaurants, and ATM machines; (3) locked gate with security guard; (4) free WiFi and breakfast; and (5) beautiful courtyard.   Cons: (1) the bathroom floor gets flooded after taking a shower; (2) loud street traffic noises intrude into the room; and (3) low-wattage lightbulbs make for a dim room at night.', \"Very central and economical hotel in Antigua. They are not listed on major booking websites but responded very quickly to the contact form on their website and seemed to be a better deal. The roof top terrace and reading room are great places to relax and have breakfast. The free sweet bread available in the morning didn't seem very impressive at first but I like it so much I spent the rest of my trip searching for something similar to no avail! Payment for the first night (which was our only night) was due via PayPal, which I liked because I didn't have to worry about having cash or paying with a card there.\", 'Had a very enjoyable for night stay in a double room. Room was very clean with reasonably comfortable beds. Bathroom was clean, with ample hot water for the shower. There is a lovely \"terrace\" on the roof, with lovely views of the city, and surrounding volcanoes. We were fortunate enough to observe some volcanic activity one day, quite a treat! There was complimentary coffee and Guatemalan baking, which combined with some fresh fruit from the market, made for an excellent breakfast. Staff is very friendly, knowledgeable, and speak English fluently. Excellent value hotel. ', 'I have liked this place, the staff was helpfull.  I have just stayed one night. The rooms are nice and clean.  I recommend others the rooms that are in the back.

It's a lovely, clean place with character and a fantastic location if you want to be very close to the centre but in a chilled street and not right in the midst of it all.  For me, the stand out thing about this accommodation was Jorge who works on reception - he was so helpful with so many things, utterly professional with great local knowledge and very friendly.\", \"Just what we needed!

The owner told us he's opening a new long-term stay place for them specifically. \", 'This is a lovely colonial style place on a locked, private street on the far west side of Antigua. The wonderful, caring and helpful staff are a big plus. Re the location: I am a walker and I found the trek to the center a bit far - 15 minutes at least, which is about a mile. People who say the walk is 5 minutes must be jogging. The last few blocks are deserted at night - probably not a good idea to walk (a taxi from the center costs 35 quetzals or about 5 dollars).   Also, even though this looks like a colonial building, the walls are super thin -- you will hear your neighbors talking, snoring, watching TV and using the bathroom. I could even hear someone unzipping a bag in an adjoining bathroom as loud as if they were in my room. Guatemalans seem fond of waking up at 6 in the', \"Spent 3 nights here at the start of our holiday.  Its a short walk from the centre of Antigua but no problem at all.  The staff were incredibly friendly and looked after us really well.  The room was spotless.  Breakfast was simple but tasty in the lovely little courtyard. I'd definitely recommend this as a place to stay to enjoy Antigua.\", \"The Casa Capucinas is a walled compound, with rooms surrounding a small garden. As the rooms are crammed together on two stories, you are at the mercy of your neighbors as far as noise goes. The courtyard/garden is pretty, but too small to allow for any privacy. The rooms are attractive in that they are restored period pieces, with furniture to match, and with updated bathrooms, but they are a bit dark. Breakfast was a joke for this price; some warmish toast, a scanty omellete, a bit of fruit, some refried beans, and generic coffee.     If you were paying $60, this would be a good deal, given the grossly inflated prices in grossly overtouristed Antigua. But at around $100 for a double, it's pretty much of a rip-off. There are certainly better deals to be had.\", 'We spent a night at Capuchinas; the hotel is pretty, beautiful gardens and very quiet. Located about 6 blocks from the main Plaza.The staff was excellent. Our room (#3?) was small; had problem with the toilet despite that we were careful not to put papers in it. There are nicer rooms at the back away from the street. We stayed in Antigua for a week and looked at quite a few accomodations. We thought this was overpriced.  I would stay there again if the rate is lower. Currently they charge $96 for a room.  You can get similar hotels for $60-70.', 'I recently stayed here for two nights with my mother on our first trip to Antigua.  We can highly recommend the hotel.  As soon as you step through the door into the courtyard, a feeling of tranquility surrounds you with nicely kept gardens.  Our room was clean and spacious. It was a bit cold but the staff kindly brought us extra blankets.  The level of customer service was high and overall this was one of the best value for money hotels that I experienced in Guatemala.  I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel to others.', 'Excellent Hotel.  Great service.  Amazing breakfast.  Perfectly located between amazing restaurants.  Rooms are great.  And let me tell you.  You will sleep like a baby.  At least in room 108.  Upper deck has a great view of Agua Volcano and Fire Volcano.  Also used to serve breakfast (at least during Holly week).

That said, they are stacked with 2, 3, 4 beds in some.   I was checked in to the back room and the small was musty, damp and the smell was overwhelming. I needed to move, but was unable to move until the next morning. It looked like it was added on at a later time or a maid quarters at one time. It was not a \"regular\" hotel room.   The only other option for me was a single room, at the same price and it smelled like blue toilet. No joke. I turned the bathroom upside down looking for the origin of the smell but could not locate anywhere. Because I had no other options at this point, I went to the store to buy air freshener....

Rooms are not very large, but they are comfortable and very clean.  They provide breakfast of banana bread and coffee at no charge and have a small bar that is surprisingly inexpensive (and rarely used).  It is very close to the city centre, great location.  Staff were very friendly and helpful, very nice owner.  Staff held our extra baggage at no extra charge while we spent the night on Acatenango.  Great internet as well.  Be warned that prices on the weekend increase significantly.  We were unaware, so the owner reduced the price to the week rate... very much appreciated.  For the price, this is impossible to beat in Antigua.', 'This hotel was perfect for two nights in Antigua, the rooms are small, but we were only there for sleeping.

The staff was always helpful and service oriented. I wanted to climb Volcan Agua, something the Consierge strongly discouraged. However, when insisting, he did help organize the local police to safeguard the climb. To me, it is not even clear if the security problem on Agua, by now is a thing of the past. Anyway, back to the hotel review: We had requested a Junior Suite and that it be quiet. The room allocated was nice, but street noise from outside was quite loud. At night, this is not really a big problem as the street has limited traffic. The pool area is a big plus for this hotel, we tend to look for this, since my wife enjoys nice pool areas.

Wifi was the strongest we've had in central america (even from our room). The owner/manager is absolutely lovely, very friendly and helpful.\\xa0   The neagtives: three huski dogs are kept downstairs and therefore the entire lower level smells strongly of dog.

I tried to be positive and tried to give it the benefit of the doubt.  However, on the second night I was bitten again. I flashed my light on the bed sheet and saw the bug trying to run away. I asked the guy sleeping in the next bottom bunk bed to try to catch the bug from my sheet and kill it.   This is only one of the problems.  The others are the cleanliness of the hostel.

Only thing I'd do differently next time is stay at the sister hotel, the Casa Rustica, a half block away. Wifi makes all the difference!  Also, the rooms are a bit small and dark-feeling, but not enough to really bother me. \", \"I spent a month at Casa Rustica and really loved it for its friendly staff, beautiful gardens and rooftop terraces, shared kitchen and livingroom areas.  It's location allowed me to go out at night alone due to its central location. In August Casa Rustica was one of the few places that offered wireless internet.  The only down side for me is that on weekends my shared bathroom was serving too many people.  Other than that, no complaints.  I felt like I was leaving family when I left. \", 'My friend and I stayed here for two nights in early-June, based primarily on its location (though the heavy advertising all around Antigua was also an influence). We were under the impression that HOTEL Casa Rustica was um, a hotel. It’s not—it is definitely a hostel. What makes it so? Abundance of rooms without private bathrooms and no daily maid service (an unpleasant surprise--this was not disclosed to us at check in). If you’re expecting this beforehand, which we weren’t, Casa Rustica is a completely adequate place to stay. However, for a hostel in Guatemala, prices are not that good. We paid $36 per night during a weekend for a room with a private bathroom; another, much nicer hotel in Antigua that we stayed in was $42 per night, and for the $6 difference, no contest, the', 'I spent eight nights at this hotel and couldn\\'t have asked for a better introduction to Antigua.    The hotel is very new and very clean.  It really has more of a \"hostel\" feel to it, which makes for a fantastic opportunity to meet travellers from all over the world, most of whom are in Antigua to study Spanish.  The rooms are simple ... but if you request room 4, you\\'ll get a massive tiled bathroom to yourself!   Darryl (the owner) and Angelica are fabulous hosts, and always ready to help with any questions ... or your Spanish. ', 'I have stayed at the Posada La Merced twice now and will absolutely stay there again on my next trip to Antigua. Both times I was on the top floor, which I liked because it was quiet (guest wise anyways - I could hear buses, dogs barking and fireworks - but that is to be expected in Antigua!) and the rooms got natural light (a friend stayed on the first floor and her room was very dark). They have a nice roof top deck with 360 degree views of the town, though you have to go down to the first floor to access the narrow stairwell up there. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and there is a small kitchen with silverware, plates and a fridge for guest use. Also there is a computer downstairs and free wifi throughout the hotel. Location is north east of the Parque Central so', \"The location is good , the hotel very quite, and staff friendly. All in all a pleasant stay although we found it a little overpriced in comparisson to other hotels and hostels in Antigua. Excellent coffee next door at Fernando's.\", 'The location is Good. The staff was friendly and helpful.  The rooms were clean.', 'I was a bit surprised upon arriving to the Hostal to find out how \"far\" it is from the Parque Central (main plaza). Don\\'t get me wrong- it is only a 10 minute walk. Still, it is located about as far as you can get from the Parque Central while still being in the charming part of Antigua. In the end the location did not detract from my visit. Also, it gives the hostal the advantage of being very, very peaceful and quiet. The staff was always helpful (even let me borrow one of their own bags since I forgot a purse; thank you!) and the price is good. However, it is not the right place for you if you are looking to be in the middle of the action in Antigua.', 'This hotel was exquisite! The layout is extravagant, the staff is courteous and helpful. It is located in the heart of Antigua, walking distance from shopping, the Wine Bar, and more! I will definitely stay there again in the future!', '...with just a couple bumps. I stayed several days as part of a group (April 2012) and experienced 3 different larger rooms. First the positives- most of which have been mentioned by others: Great location, charming garden areas, pleasant decor, friendly & helpful staff, coffee and safe drinking water available, PC in lobby, good breakfasts, nice shop. As for the negatives (bumps): I would agree that the room lighting is very dim, maybe partially due to the very high ceilings. This could be a problem if you like to read in bed, need to do desk work, or just prefer brighter rooms. The other bumps we noticed were room-specific: one room lacked any sort of hook or place to hang clothes, and in another one the bathroom had an extremely strong, unpleasant smell of deodorizer.  All', \"This was my 3rd trip to Guatemala & my first 2 stays were exceptional.  I thought I would like our group to be closer to the center of town this time so I took a chance on the El Carmen.  While the location is terrific & the people are very kind & accommodating, the facility itself was a huge disappointment.  We had 4 rooms, 2 of which smelled VERY moldy & even made one of our group members feel sick (headache).  All 4 rooms only had cold water for showers on our 2nd day there. It is very loud since the majority of the rooms face an open, bright & echoey  courtyard. And I didn't ask the others, but our window curtains weren't wide enough (room 202) so light came in at night when the lights were on in the hotel AND people could see in! My husband actually walked outside &\", \"It's a beautiful boutique hotel some of the rooms are pretty small so be careful because you can get fooled by the pictures. We loved our stay but we had some issues I have to point out: there is no AC, so if you are someone who gets hot at night this might be an issue. Our bathroom had a leak and the staff were great at fixing it right away. Our bedroom was right next to the street so that made it pretty difficult for us to rest because of the cars and sound. However, the hotel is in perfect location, right on the center of the city so everything is walking distance. I would recommend it considering these things and I would definitely come back. \", 'This hotel does NOT look like the pictures on the website, is insanely overpriced and was a huge disappointment. Our room (for 85usd/night) was cramped, had visible mold on the rafters and walls, smelled terrible (like mold and lacquer) was quite dirty and had no hot water. On arrival, they tried to charge us at their own arbitrary exchange rate instead of the official rate and were not able to provide a fan when we complained about the stuffiness and smell. The only alternative was to open a window right behind the bed which created a security risk and allowed the noise and smoke from a 3am party on the roof above us to wake us up. We got absolutely NO sleep! The man at the front desk was quite nice and breakfast would have been good but it arrived cold. In general, it has a', \"Great location run by a lovely friendly and very accommodating and family, especially the son José!

Can't go wrong with this accomodation, would definitely recommend!😊\", \"Firstly I would say that this hotel is in a really good location and the staff were really helpful and friendly. What I didn't like so much was that the room was really damp and mouldy, this might have been worse because we were on the ground floor at the end of the corridor, because of the damp there were lots of damp related tiny bugs crawling around. Also agree with other reviews where they say the bathrooms are tiny and you can't sit on the toilet seat properly and the power outlets are minimal and really high so they are difficult to use.Only place I've ever stayed in Antigua so not sure what the general quality of accommodation is like, this was a functional stay, but I wouldn't be in a hurry to go back to this hotel.\", \"We stayed 4 nights in this hotel.  The room was ok sized and good tv and fan, but the toilet was very small and the WC was too close to the wall. There were just two electricity plugs and in an impractical position.  The staff was extremely attentive, the owner and Jose help us with many travel tips, booking tours and shuttles.  In general is a nice hotel and the prices are fine, it's well located and we recommend it.  Try the Panaderia Santa Clara in the next corner for nice breakfast and meals and take away pastries. \", 'Spent 2 nights in September 2015 in Hotel Las Piletas. The location is great - close to the main square, to shops and restaurants. The staff was very friendly and helpful when we had questions.

When we came to pay they did the following:   For simplicity lets assume the price of the room they quote is $100 including taxes and fees. When you go pay they charge you Q800 when the exchange rate is 7.5. Then the blatant lie they say is the machine decides the exchange rate, when the person inputting the amount is the girl in the reception. This is clearly a technique that they use to show you a certain price and then charge you more!!   In addition our room did not have hot water and internet did not reach the suite.   The only saving grace of this place is the restaurant staff and cleaning crew. They were great.   ', 'We stayed here two days before transferring to Portas Antigua for a trip. Los Olivos had beautiful rooms, a nice breakfast, and very central location. Staff is warm and welcoming; they made two trips at no extra cost to transfer us and our bags. Some have good English, others not, so it helps to be adventurous if (say) you\\'re coming in late at night.   On the other hand, you might hear noise from night clubs a few blocks away. Suggestion: ASK FOR A ROOM IN THE BACK away from reception and BRING EAR PLUGS. (#1 and #3 are immediately across; we had one of those.)   FYI, Portas is \"nicer\" but also much larger and has a bit of a corporate feel. Glad we\\'re at both places, and could enjoy something a bit more local in Olivos.

The ruins across the street make the setting interesting and intriguing--plus help in locating it at night after wandering the streets all day.  Room:  The sheets are crisp, blankets cozy and sufficient for the chilly evenings, pillows fluffy, and bathroom towels are new enough and clean.  Our room (#4) had a little bit of a sewer gas smell at night due to the shower drain, I believe, so we showered at night to freshen up, and kept the door closed, which took care of the problem.

Fair price, the rate includes breakfast wich we are still considering wether to take or not since there are many good places to have breakfast in Antigua.  They do not have food service at other times of the day, just breakfast.  We like it but its location is not too good and there is not good noise isolation, we heard the street noises all too well. If you are using your own car the parking is like one block walking distance so if you came too late or want to go out at night youll have to consider this. And if you have no car youll have to walk a lot to get to Antiguas downtown. ', 'Situated at the western end of town next to the market, this small hostel was good value.

As has been mentioned in other reviews the rooms are small & the bathroom extremely cramped. However they are kept very clean.  There has been a change in ownership since my first stay in 2009 & every stay since the change has been just a little worse, the staff aren't as helpful, some can't speak any English, Wi Fi barely works, which combined with a price increase each trip is not good.  The location at the north end of town is kind of out of the way, especially when one has spent the evening at Café No Sé & (for safety) has to take a taxi back.

The only reason I gave this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is that there's no air conditioning and we had to request a fan because our room was quite hot and there are no screens on the doors so you can't leave them open for ventilation.  From the moment we walked in the staff was so helpful and nice and I really cannot say enough about them.  There is always fresh water in your room which is nice and the pool is great.  We spent a lot of time doing very adventurous time in Antigua so it was nice to have a very relaxing home base that was very close to everything.  Made it very easy for us to enjoy our stay.\", 'First, may I say this is a sprawling property with multiple locations. It is truly beautiful there. So beautiful that everyone in town wants to have a wedding there. This is understandable.   What is not understandable is how poor their management staff is. If you book a higher budget room, I can see how one could have a nice stay. We, however, did not.   Our first mistake was booking a room thru Expedia. Never before and never again. Nothing against Expedia, but they put you in a very average room away from all that is gorgeous. But that is not my complaint. When we arrived in the evening, exhausted by travel, we were greeted by not by one, but by 2 weddings that were so loud you could hardly hold a conversation in the room.   What was shocking was how the management dealt with', 'We stay at hotel for long weekend, found it a bit crowd, but still usable amenities.

The window was broken but the people at reception offered me to change the room. There were helpful also in other concerns. The patio was the breakfast-room. I found that not so cozy. During daytime it can be nice to use the roof garden. When breakfast is included, you get only one cup of coffee. If you want more, you have to pay for it. I did not experience that in Guatemala and Mexico before.', \"We used the hotel as a base for exploring Antigua and area plus as an early 7am departure to climb Acatenango.  They were very helpful in storing unneeded bags while we were away at no charge.  Desayunos is reasonable at 30q and the rancheros are awesome  Excellent little courtyard makes for nice ambience but the concrete construction does amplify some of that Antigua hustle and bustle so don't expect to sleep in as you will hear people up and about.     Big terrace too.  Great for star gazing or the super moon.  As with almost all hotels its close to all things (Central Antigua isn't terribly large).  We didnt have a car but parking would be an issue.  On our first night Misrael was cheery and excellent.  Our second night the hotel was super busy and Pablo Torres was grumpy. \", 'This hotel is very centrally located to the main square. It has a central dining area surrounded by the rooms, and an upper terrace with a great view of the surrounding area.  We stayed here on two occasions, the first time our room was directly over the open internal area, so we could hear quite a bit of activity below us, the next time we were in a room off the stairs to the terrace, which was quieter.   It seems this hotel caters to large groups and events and hosts these groups which can make the hotel more busy and loud then other hotels.   Unlike other hotels which has drinking water easily available if you want a bottle filled, the front desk person has to go and fill the bottle up for you.   The breakfast here was more varied then other hotels and bigger, which is great', 'Fabulous location for a great price!

However the staff was very nice.  We left early before breakfast one morning and they packed up our breakfast to go for us.  They also have coffee available all day and complimentary bottled water that is replenished each day.  The only complaint is that the music in the club right next door was pretty loud in our room all three nights we were there, from probably around 10pm to midnight or 1am.

Everyone was generally friendly and helpful, but I took off one star because we needed help on our final morning and felt that the staff could have been more attentive.  I became sick a few hours before we had to go to the airport (most likely sickness left over from Lake Atitlan, not from Panza Verde), and all they offered was a packet of \"Sal Andrews\"- the equivalent of Alka Seltzer, I think.

The location is also problematic if you get any room facing the street. The street noise is super loud and starts about 6:00am. With no fans or air conditioner your option is to suffer the stuffy heat or the noise of an open window.  Breakfast is included in your room but it should be noted that it’s the continental only.

Some things to note are that you can hear everything going on in the room next-door which is awkward and for me kept me awake because my neighbor was a snorer! It sounded like he was snoring right in my ear it was so loud! Very frustrating. Secondly, the included breakfast is delicious, but it is served to you by a waiter.

The rooms while clean are very worn, the bathroom has hot water but is cramped, can't throw toilet paper in the toilet.  That said, I think this is what passes for a nice hotel in Antigua.  Certainly there are probably some nicer and pricier ones, but despite the condition and age of this hotel, I think it is the equivalent of a Sheraton in Antigua.

One room (204 I believe) had a distinct smell of mold. The occupants filched a fan from the hallway but it didn't help much. We were able to get the one and only other fan from the front desk and it regenerated the air in the room nicely. One thing we don't like though is that you do have to keep the windows open to get any air in the room -- a security hazard.\", \"We arrived in the evening and to our surprise no parking.

My wife had to go ask to please turn it off since we were leaving really early in the am. After roaches episode we didn't even want to see what was for breakfast. Please get more helpful staff, too many incidents.\", 'El Carmen is within walking distance of all you want to see in Antigua!  The beds were super comfortable.  The linens were 4 star.

Only downside: My room was a room with three beds - upstairs.  The fan did not work.  Since there is no air-conditioning - it was uncomfortably hot.', \"My husband and I are semi frequent travelers to Antigua, we love the town, but we live on a budget, so when a friend came to visit we decided to try El Carmen because of its reasonable price and excellent reviews.  While there are some excellent points to this hotel, it does need some work.  First the good, the staff were super friendly and helpful and attentive.  The beds were comfortable and the decor of the hotel charming.  The breakfast was excellent, very typical Guatemalan food, with several options to choose from, and includes juices and coffee.  I was disappointed that they never had tortillas as they advertised tortillas or bread, but the totilla woman never came in the two days we were there.

Young guy at the reception, Julio was very helpful.  It's a small 2 floored hotel with small rooms and even smaller toilets. All the rooms look to a tranquil alley with lots of flowers. I would give 5 if the toilet was a bit bigger. I'm just 175cm and I can not use the toilet without my knees touching the wall.

But my niece and I stayed here for three nights and there are definite pros and cons.   Pros – We stayed here for about $120 total for three nights over New Years. Considering what I was seeing online at the time, we got a smoking good deal. The staff here was some of the nicest people we met on our trip. The owner, as many previous posts share, was delightful. His English was great which made learning about Antigua a lot easier. The TV has a few English channels, and most fun was an 80s music channel which really is just awesome. The location was phenomenal and I cannot emphasize enough, get your bearings quickly. People warned me about getting lost in this city and it always', 'This hotel was reccommmended by the Villa Sumaya reservation staff.  It was a delight. Above all the restaurant was a very pleasant surprise. Excellent combination of flavors and the steep price was justified by this fact, but also the presentation was a lust to the eye ;-) I had a junior suite, number 10 with a fireplace in the room an a large bathroom. All the bath products are natural. Stayed only one night but it was a pleasant experience.', \"This hotel was highly recommended by a friend who has stayed here several times so I gambled and was not disappointed.  First off it's conveniently located.  Then again, Antigua is small enough that just about anywhere is centrally located.  That being said the hotel is a single story, courtyard hotel, with a majority of the rooms opening to the central courtyard.  It has a small fountain, a grassy area with lounge chairs and an abundance of flowers and plants.  The receptionist/desk people speak English well enough to assist us single language tourists quite well.  The room my grandson and I stayed in for four days was a double and was roomy enough for us to get around in with no problems at all.  It's not heated nor air conditioned and most of the local residents were telling\", 'We have stayed at 3 different hotels in Antigua. I rank this as 2nd favorite, mostly because of the great location and the immaculate and beautifully furnished room. The rooms are large with soaring ceilings, but it reminds me a bit of being in a monastery. The bed was super comfy, nice bathroom but if you are a big or tall person the shower will probably be too small for you. I think anyone over 5 foot 10 inches would have a hard time in the shower. Breakfast was continental style, toast, cereal and the like. If you wanted eggs or anything warm, you had to order and pay for it. That part I didn’t like as the other 2 hotels in Antigua where we stayed included breakfast, for the same price we paid at Aurora.', \"This hotel is nice, it has a quiet and relaxed environment. Staff are nice and welcoming, it's conveniently located very close to the main square and main attractions in Antigua.  Stay at a suite, very nice although the bathroom is weirdly distributed which makes the whole shower situation a bit uncomfortable.  We had breakfast included which was plentiful and tasty but the service was a bit slow.  It does not offer car park. \", 'The rooms are very clean. The reading room and the rooftop patio are great. Water, coffee, tea and computer always available. Rosario and Carlos are very friendly and helpful.

I admit I wrote my review after a very frustrating day followed up by an extra person squished in to our room.  I would firstly like to make valid Carlos' effort with customers and guests. He ensures everyone feels welcome and offers up freely suggestions and helpful hints, but the same can't be said for the female partner. The rooms although very squished are kept clean the only bathroom is also clean and has hot water always. The wifi is fast and pretty reliable. The beds are comfortable and the linen clean.

The location is nice. Antigua is small and you can pretty much get anywhere walking. The hotel was very clean and beautiful colonial style. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and welcoming.   My only negative comment about my stay at this place was the shower would not drain the water properly. I had to lift and hold the drainage tool for the water to go down.

I stayed at the hotel a week while attending Spanish school and it happened to be during Holy Week in Guatemala, so the room was pretty pricy.   The location is good, just a few blocks walk to the Cathedral, Arco and many Antigua shops and restaurants.  It's not the hotel's fault, but the incessant barking from the dog next door was a nuisance and the windows are thin and small. So I had to close the windows, which did little to mask the noise from the dog, but it did make the room even warmer (there is no AC in majority of hotels in Guatemala).

As for the hotel attributes, I can't comment since did not stay there.\", \"The hotel has been redecorated recently, and the common areas look really good, especially the patio that dominates the middle of the hotel - the garden is great. Also good is the bed, large and with a firm mattress it is very comfortable. There is a large TV with lots of channels, if you like it.   But then, my gripes start. My room had just a window giving to an internal corridor - thus, no natural light, and very limited ventilation (no a/c, by the way). If you open the window and curtains you are exposed to anyone passing by. This also make the apartment very noisy, unless you have a very heavy sleep, you'll wake up around 6.30 when the employees arrive and start chatting and sweeping the floor.  There is no desk in the room, so not a place to be if you plan to do some work.\", \"The hotel is in a good location, only about 3 blocks from the main square.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The hotel is clean, as are the rooms.  The rooms aren't overly spacious, but I never felt cramped.

The wifi was good, as was the cable TV (even had a few American channels)\", 'I stayed here for one night. A little tricky to find, but at easy walking distance from lots of restaurants and the main areas of Antigua. The rooms are decently sized for the price, good enough if you just want to spend the night on the cheap. There’s only one window in the room, which opens into the courtyard and doesn’t have netting, so I didn’t feel comfortable leaving it open while I slept. That made things a little stuffy. Also the shower in the bathroom only has a hot and cold option, but no temperature control. The covered courtyard is lovely though, and the owner and his son (I think) were warm and welcoming and helped me arrange a reliable shuttle to the airport.', 'Excellent place to stay on a budget.

Bathroom was very petite with the toilet very close to the wall. Ok shower but tricky to get temp right. Only two plug sockets in room and one was being used for the TV. Wifi was rubbish in the room but worked well in the common area/ courtyard. Brilliant location - close to restaurants & the main square - only a couple blocks away & meant it was in a quiet street.

Extraordinarily lovely room at the casa buena vista with a fantastic separate shower/toilet facility. Also, its spotless which is hard to find in the area.  The staff here are generally pretty rude though, for one dinner the dessert was almost thrown onto the table and one of the requests my partner made for specific dietary requirements for which this place prides itself were ignored/blamed on miscommunication (a common theme when I'm reading through other negative reviews). Mad props to the curly haired guy who sorted me out some ice when I asked though.

A very good experience -- we would be glad to stay again.', \"The place certainly looks nice, it's got nice art around the hotel and it's got a rustic atmosphere. The bed is comfortable enough and decent sized rooms. However, when you look at the details, you can't help but notice that there is some work to be done. The courtyards need some maintenance, and I don't really understand what's going on with all the mirrors in the building - including at the door and shutters of the room.  It is repetitive of previous reviews but: 1. No hot water.  2. No wifi in the rooms - I didn't mind as much for my short stay. 3.

Our room had a nice Queen bed and a Jacuzzi! We loved the Jacuzzi, it was so relaxing and added a special touch to our stay. The bed sheets, the towels, everything was nice and clean. I would say the only drawbacks would be that the parking lot was around the corner and we had to walk a little bit—luckily it seemed safe. The colonial windows are gorgeous but the curtains don't quite cover the windows well when there is wind, so if you need more privacy you may want to really make sure you have the curtains closed well, as other guests could take a peek into your room.

Average dinner meals were about $15-$25 - Friendly staff that speak English. - Lovely terrace for basking in the sun while sipping on some wine -Excellent view of the mountains from the terrrace  Cons - Rooms are a bit small - No AC in the rooms.

The courtyard full of flowers was beautiful and soothing.   Only a few things stop it from being perfect.  While the hotel is secure requiring you to be buzzed in and out, the person at the desk was often missing. It was never clear the reason but you often had to buzz several times and wait.  The showers took some work to figure out. After 2 days of cold showers, a staff member showed me how to make it warm.  It is not at all intuitive.  Still, as a group we loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again.  Ask for Room 21!', 'Great location only being 3 blocks from the central plaza.  Rooms are nicely decorated and clean.

Spotlessly clean. Beds are firm but comfortable. I had a big room described as a 'suite' which also had a small kitchen with a cooker, fridge and micro-wave, but no cooking utensils or plates - perhaps you have to negotiate that separately.

The windows didn\\'t close entirely so it\\'s not a hermetically sealed bug-free environment : )  I honestly thought $46 was a bit high for the room but that\\'s probably because Antigua was just more expensive than my final destination (San Pedro La Laguna).

On arrival at 11am after being awake and travelling since 2am, we were told that we couldn't check in until 5pm because all their rooms were full and they all had to be cleaned.  I understand that hotels can offer early check-ins all the time.  However, we saw two rooms being cleaned and another couple were checking out as we were attempting to check-in.  The female receptionist was rude and did nothing to assist us - no offer to sit down or have breakfast, no suggestion as to where we could wait.  She actually told us it 'wasn't her problem'.

Secondly we booked for 2 twin beds, but the extremely unhelpful female receptionist stated that they have none of these beds available, regardless that that is what I booked, and paid for and what is advertised on expedia and on their own website, the four of us ended up having to share a bed and was not offered a discount on the price.

We did not have all the gear to carry everything, so we paid the extra (negotiated it down to 450 each for 5 people). Our backpacks were packed tight with warm clothing cause it gets very cold up there. They said there would be one more person doing the tour with us and promised a guide that spoke English.

There was music or a TV BLASTING at full volume round the clock in the central courtyard which everyone can hear right through the paper-thin walls. I also heard EVERY SINGLE WORD of the multiple conversations that people had outside our door. I was woken up at 6am both mornings by people's conversations. It sounded like the walls didn't even exist. I'm shocked more people haven't mentioned the noise in their reviews. If noise bothers you even a tiny bit, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

The food was pretty good, higher priced then we have been paying while traveling but still not too bad. Happy hour was a nice treat. Only complaint is it appeared we were bothering the staff when asking for drinks or to order food. One staff in particular, I think her name was Dory. We asked to look at some of their shirt options to buy a few and it was pretty uncomfortable. I would hope in the future they would be a bit kinder, especially when people are spending money to support their lodge.

You don't have wifi in the rooms. The view from the cabins and the restaurant are wonderful. So why no 5 stars? Because there are 2 things we didn't like: 1) the hotel is a few hundred meters downhill from the road. And I really mean downhill. So it takes you just a few minutes to walk down to the lodge, but much more to get back to the road again. You have to carry your own luggage, the hotel charges a high fee to do it for you.

Bingo. Bango. ', \"Let me start by saying that Tanya is extremely welcoming and accommodating. The hostel is lovely and her heart is in the right place. The same cannot be said for the other staff. I found myself subjected to an awful soap opera drama that unfolded before me during my visit, of which I was the unfortunate witness. The constant arguing between the 'ex-husband' and 'boyfriend' staff members was more than I could bare, especially considering they were both intoxicated and airing their dirty laundry for everyone to see. The Costa Rican gentleman made me feel most uncomfortable, as he was stinking drunk the entire time, eliminating his inhibitions to act inappropriately toward the guests. It's almost humorous to look back on, but I was thoroughly upset and put off by his behaviour. I\", 'Room 11 has incredible views of the volcano. Cute rooftop. Friendly service. Minimal English and not much for breakfast _ just local sweet breads. We enjoyed our stay here and recommend it if you like the smaller more local accommodation. Also hot water and comfy beds ', \"I guess this place is definitely dependent on which room you stay in. We stayed in the cheaper room which seemed small and didn't have the nice views and fridge that other people praised. We still had private bathroom with hot water and TV. Rooftop terrace was nice, especially on New Years Eve when we could see incredible panorama of fireworks from all over city, but mainly focused around Merced church which is only a few blocks away. Church bells didn't start ringing until 7:30 am so didn't bother our sleep. Main square is a bit more of a hike, around 15 minutes. No breakfast included, just coffee and Guatemalan bread, but Caffe Fernando is next door which had good breakfast. Next time would probably pay a few more dollars to stay in a nicer room.\", \"If you're on a budget, you can't beat this! The rooms are tiny(I had to sit sideways on the loo!)but it's super cheap and clean.....Alvaro the host is charming, friendly and a wealth of info providing tips etc on where to eat and he'll go out of his way to help you...he stored our backpacks for us when we took off for a one night trip to Lake Atitlan. The location is good, close to Park Centrale and suited our needs perfectly. Also had a small but cute central courtyard.\", 'The boy at the desk extremely helpful and friendly.Nice small courtyard outside the rooms to chill.Room nice but advertised as having wardrobe and there was none.Dont stay in room 6,the metal stairs is right outside window and is really noisy when someone walks on it.My friend and I paid Q600 between us for 3 nights,no breakfast included so this is more expensive than other choices.', 'The hotel has tiny rooms, but the location and the incredibly helpful owner, Alvaro, more than make up for the small rooms. Alvaro helped us with seeing the city on foot, giving great advice on where to eat, buy groceries, places to see and tours to take. His staff is also very pleasant giving the feeling of being a guest, not at a hotel.  Recommendations: bring a set of earplugs as hotel has street noise and can have common area noise (we bring earplugs to all hotels).   With the shower, set with a small amount of water as the heater is on demand and if you push too much pressure through it, you won;t get the hot water you desire.  We will return to this place.', 'My friend and I stayed here a few nights. Carlos is hilarious and thoughtful, and deserves a pat on the back for a wonderful establishment. It was clean and quiet, convenient if you want to meet other travelers, yet spacious enough for you to not chat with anyone. We came home one afternoon to a cool pubcrawl social gathering in our courtyard, but that was the only time it was particularly noisy, and it settled quickly after they crawled on. Our room was close to the center courtyard. It felt like coming home! Comfy beds, ceiling fan, \"suicide shower\" but not anything out of the ordinary in Central America. Will stay there again when we head back for New Year\\'s!', \"Ok. Here's the deal. I met Carlos and his wife Hazel several weeks ago. I've eaten at the restaurant portion of Posada San Carlos and found it to be  satisfying, well prepared, and budget friendly. I took a tour of the rooms with Carlos and found them also  very acceptable and for a private, doable even though there wasn't a private bath ensuite. Carlos takes pride in his efforts as Hazel does also. The place is clean, light, and fresh and quiet ....or so it appeared on the several occasions I visited. This young couple remind me of folks I've known and even though I can't exactly pin it down, it must have been pleasant for I truly enjoy the moments in their company chatting. Posada de San Carlos is an upscale Hostal and one that deserves appreciation.  Downside ? Limited menu\", 'The place is nice and at a first look you\\'d say you got a good deal For the price until you get to the room and:  1. No WIFI IN THE ROOMS (and they know this)  2. YOU HAVE TO ASK FOR HOT WATER. We had to ask twice to get the heater on for hot water...really?  3. The bathroom sink is next to your bed   4. Rooms smell like HUMIDITY, the woman that showed me the room agreed.   5. The parking is not in the premises and it\\'s a 10 minute walk.  The issue is that the staff is been trained to offer you no solutions, when I went to ask about he wifi their reply was: \"it works in the hallways\" meaning they knew it and didn\\'t care. I said \"when I called you you could have told me that you had internet only in the hallways.\" She sort of smirked and said \"accept our apology\".  Bottom line,', \"One of the rare Hotels, that do not trust the guest. You have to pay before check-in, and you are not allowed to leave, before they checked the room you have left. In addition to have to sign something, that you don not drink alkohol in the room and more. Really disappointing. I'm a 50 year old Business man and was treated as a potential thief. Never ever again.\", \"Nice small hotel, good size rooms, bad bathroom design as hand wash is just beside bed. No room for storage. Rooms need ventilation! Some rooms with old TV. Too few breakfast options with some items not availabe, but good quality. Nice and good coffee. WiFi not available on rooms. Weekday price quality ratio can be improved. Weekend price too high. Parking lot is small and 4 blocks away, they claim they provide free transport but it doesn't happen to me. Rooms are not noise insulated as you can hear anything from outside, which in the morning was nice to be wake up by birds singing. I will stay again on weekday rate.\", \"Place was nice and also excellent location, but: 1. Second night, they tried to charge us for a toilet we didn't break; 2. First breakfast we arrived at 9:40 and they served us, but last day staff said breakfast was served until 9:30 (on a Sunday), so service its kind of unreliable; 3. Parking place is like 3 blocks away, which they don't tell you until you get to the hotel; 4. Rooms are nice, but there's no A/C and you would think you don't need it but you do, no fans either. I personally would not stay here again. \", 'Nice place, but a horrible staff. 1. Walked us to our room, did not offer to help with bags. 2. Parking 3 blocks away in a sketchy area, no valet service 3. Told us breakfast was served at 10, staff laughed at us when we arrived at 9:40 and missed breakfast.', \"Great location half block from main square. Very charming. Also has nice little bar, cafe , and good restaurants right next door.  I was surprised that they didn't even have a fan in the room though, and so it was stuffy and hot at night. It was fine if you opened the windows, but then you were subject to noise of other guests coming and going, and noise from outside. Had to sleep with ear plugs nightly, although maybe other hotel that central are always going to be noisy. If there had been a fan in the room, it would have been quiet enough with the windows shut. roof top terrace is great. of course, at other times of the year, the rooms may not be as hot. There's even a jacuzzi on top but never had a chance to use it.\", 'We went here Easter Sunday with our friends who live in Guatemala full time.  First let me say that El Hato, the pueblo that surrounds Earth Lodge is really charming and the real deal Guatemala.  It was here we saw the women walking with large water jugs on their head, women gathering at the single water tap in the pueblo, men, women and children carrying wood and sticks on their backs and heads.  And lots and lots of dogs and little children playing.  In order to get to Earth Lodge you must hike down about 300 meters a somewhat steep dirt hillside.  They do have \"stairs\\' for those who feel like they need that grounding.  Our friend just had knee surgery and was able to do it, albeit slowly, but was able to do it.  Of course the kids loved sliding down the hillside!  There are', 'The \"treehouse\" style room was very clean, albeit the accommodation is simple.  The room however had amazing views which was undoubtedly the highlight for us. The bathroom is not directly attached to the room (Casa del Encino), its outside and behind the room (something to note as night time toilet runs involve going outside). Overall when it comes to the accommodation itself, the room was nice and for the views it provided we were pleased.  However we were quite disappointed with the \"family style\" dinner. Note there is a set menu and no alternative menu to order from.  The meal was 70Q per person.  We found this meal very poor value considering our meal was spaghetti carbonara, with corn, spinach (very small serving), and zucchini (one small piece).  Considering the meal did', 'we booked at the last minute and Gerlinde was so helpful Jorge at the front desk was also very helpful I have been to Antigua some 20 times since 2004, and would recommend this hotel as  a  very good and reasonable place to stay', \"Good value for the money.  Make sure you go up to the highest roof for a great view of Antigua and the surrounding mountains.  Fernando's next door was great for morning coffee and afternoon Gallo (cerveza).  Walking distance to anything you'd want to walk to.\", \"I stayed in Porta Hotel Antigua July 2016. I stayed for a good week and the room and people were great!   I had to give it a 3 rating and here's why.   1) NO SCREENS ON WINDOWS. The room gets stuffy so naturally we wanted fresh air. We were being eaten alive and was given a plug-in mosquito repellent which it didn't work. Screens for the windows are cheaper and better then a plug-in bug repellent, in my opinion. OH! and if you have a window that's facing the street (and want the window open for fresh air?) you'll be woken up by trucks and people talking. So be VERY specific where you want your room to be.   2) They charge you for local calls! I talked to the front desk about it and someone mentioned to me it's because they are under contract, with the telephone company to do so.\", \"This was a darling hotel - and we got a terrific deal on it, too. The courtyard was beautiful, the room was quite nice (if very small, but if you go to Antigua to spend it all in your hotel then you're doing it all wrong). The staff was so helpful and the breakfast (included) was delicious. The fatal flaw, however, is that as it is all wrapped around the central courtyard, you hear everything outside your window - from people checking in at midnight to the group who got up and chatted at full volume back and forth across the courtyard at 6:30am on a Saturday. Closing the windows would probably help, but this hotel - like most every place in Antigua - doesn't have AC, so this is not a good plan. Bottom line - if you are a deep sleeper, and/or an early bird, I'd recommend this\", 'Total crap! Expensive, non service, trheated us like kriminals. No wifi, bad drinks and no other visitors. Clean pool and shower area. Bar closed. The staff (lots of them) show no interest in service us.', 'Food service is excellent. Breakfast included in room rate. Paid a little more for buffet but worth it.  Attentive service from staff, guest service personnel bilingual. grounds kept very well. Rooms were cleaned timely. All staff pleasant and willing to serve its clientele. Wifi a little weak for streaming, but more than adequate for email and web browsing.', 'This is an excellent option except if you are traveling for work, there is no internet in the rooms and they don’t tell you, but charge extra for it. Food is good, the staff is friendly and rooms are big and clean. A lot of space. The distance of the hotel to the main sights is another issue of this hotel. ', \"The plantation is very beautiful and surprisingly close to Antigua (just a short cab ride to the north). We enjoyed the horseback riding tour of the grounds and found it hilarious that they name their horses after US Presidents (mine was Jack Kennedy and my wife's was Lyndon Johnson). The trail is pretty narrow and steepish in a couple of places so they don't let you ride alone, but rather with a guide who has rope leads to the horses to help keep them on the path. But it was still enjoyable. We ate at the restaurant and the food and coffee were both good. The views from the property were lovely also. The only negative was that I left my glasses in their case on the table and didn't realize it until after we got back to our hotel. We called and the hotel staff looked for them\", 'Hotel Sor Juana was very accommodating. They sorted a last minute, late night taxi pick-up for us from Guat City which was much appreciated. The rooftop patio provides striking views of the surrounding volcanoes and is a lovely space to start the day with breakfast. The coffee served here set a high bar for the rest of our Guatemala journey that was not surpassed. The owner showed us around the property and provided some of the history - much appreciated! Would stay here again - but in one of the larger rooms.', 'I stayed at Sor Juana for two days with my wife and in-laws from South Africa and we loved the place. Small and far away from the buzz of the main square. It is also close enough to take walks everywhere. Lovely terrace breakfasts.', 'From outside the hotel is very unassuming but once you get inside it has great old world charm. The staff were very friendly and helpful. They were able to organize a trip to the Coffee Plantation with no fuss. The room is spacious and comfortable. The WiFi was good. Breakfast was good and served on the roof terrace with views of the Volcanoes. The location was great within 10 minutes walking distance of the town square. My only complaint was that the shower did not work well.', 'A really nice, recently new hostel that is perfect for a few nights. Showers and bathrooms are clean (with hot water!!). Staff is very helpful, and they can organize cheap shuttles and tours for you. I did the Acatenango hike and a shuttle through them- no problems with either. It can be very, very loud at times since some of the rooms are right against the bar. It is a fun hostel, definitely more for the social crowd who wants to go out! I would stay here again for sure.', \"I spent one night in this very good (excellent seems a bit too much, excellency involves much more) hostel. As other reviewers mentioned Tanja is a very nice host, full of energy and apparently enjoying her job - same can't be said regarding others there.   The three bunks dorm is excellent, full of natural light, with a view to the nearby vulcano. And it's spacey and the windows are huge and easy to control, making it possible to get a fair amount of fresh air during the day, and then, by dusk, when the temperatures go down, close the windows to keep the room warm.  The terrace is also a great feature and there is free filtered water, coffee and tea. I never used the kitchen but it can be handy for guests.   Location is good but the neighbors ruin a bit the experience. Not that\", \"I stayed at Capitan Tom about two weeks ago and had a mostly positive experience, apart from the behaviour of one member of staff. The dorm rooms are very cheap and Tanya (not sure if she's the owner or a member of staff) was very lovely and accommodating, even managing to our laundry in less than a day. The kitchen was very well equipped, including with use of oil and spices so you don't have to buy them just to use a little. The free coffee is also good.   However, we noticed that one of the members of staff was either drunk or hungover the entire time we were there. As he was in a position of responsibility, this made us quite uncomfortable and it also led to miscommunication with some of the other guests. For example, some women in our dorm had washed clothes, only to find\", 'Very pleasant place, quiet and comfortable, not too far from the center....People charming and rooms very beautiful !', 'Great value for your money.  It is a brand new hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful for city information. The only minor drawback was because it is centered around a courtyard, you do hear the chatter that takes place outside.', 'Our group stays here when we come to work in Antigua. It is clean, comfortable and has a beautiful garden. The staff are wonderful- helpful, friendly- they always make us feel welcome. A great location, too.  The rooms in the back are the best. ', 'We spent 2 nights here in May.  Loved the central courtyard/garden. A convenient location, with a short walk to town.  The only drawback was the traffic noise outside our window. Like many places in Guatemala, there is no air conditioning, so the choice was: window open, noise and car exhaust, or window closed and sweating.  I believe some rooms on the other side of the courtyard do not open to the street, so consider requesting one of those rooms.', \"This is the oldest purpose-built hotel in Antigua, dating from the 1920s.  It's 20-some rooms surround a traditional courtyard.  I've been returning here for years.  The rooms are traditionally furnished with modern bathrooms.  It's quiet enough at night.  Location is ideal, 2 or 3 blocks east of the city's main square.  The restaurant offers only breakfast, and with a limited menu.  Not the place to stay if you're after a varied nightlife.  Do pick it though if you're seeking an hotel matching the ambiance of Antigua.\", \"Like many Antigua hotels, El Carmen has a charming courtyard atrium where you can eat a B+ breakfast cooked by the wait staff right near your table. The hotel desk staff are really friendly and helpful (like when I lost my room key). Rooms are simple and don't expect much for amenitites, but the price reflect the simplicity and it's a great value. Central location in town is also really good. \", 'We had high hopes for this hotel because of the reviews. It did not meet our expectations. Although the property is beautiful and clean the service is abysmal. The rooms are small with no chairs or sitting areas. We arrived with a fair amount of luggage. There was no one available to help with the luggage. We had a one bed room the first night. The second night our son joined us. Although the room with two beds was empty the night we arrived, they would not let us stay there. They did no offer any help in moving our luggage to the second room. There were only 2 towels for 3 people. It took 4 calls to the desk to get another towel. The hotel touts its hot tub. We find when we arrived that it closes at 7:00 pm and that a reservation had to bemade. We reserved the hot tub and they', \"I've stayed at Hotel El Carmen for 8 years straight. The rooms were always clean with nice decorations. This place is not super fancy, but for the safety, quality and level of customer service, it's a bargain! For anyone wanting a genuine Guatemalan experience and atmosphere as opposed to a tourist one, this is the place to stay. The management and staff were very attentive and courteous, often going above and beyond to satisfy the guests. The food is also fresh and quite tasty. I highly recommend Hotel El Carmen for the adventurous traveler seeking charming and affordable accommodations!  M. Skinner (USA)\", 'My husband, our young son and I stayed several nights in Antigua and this place was comfortable and pretty.  Reasonably priced, very clean, free wifi, and the breakfast was delicious.  The people working there were also very nice.  There was a mixup when booking where we requested 2 double beds, and when they confirmed it was for 1 queen bed.  I wrote and explained that we needed a bed for our son, and they said they could put a small bed in there for him.  That was not ideal, but not a deal-breaker, so we went with it.  When we arrived, they actually upgraded us to a nicer room with 2 double beds and we were very happy.  It is a little ways away from the parque central, so away from all the people but not too far to walk easily.  I would recommend to people who want something', \"I would like to start by emphasising that this budget hotel has a very friendly and helpful day manager (Don Alvaro) and great night staff. They were willing to help when our 9 sqrm room (including a tiny shower) felt horribly damp and stuffy. Unfortunately there was not much they could do. Our room (two small single beds and no wardrobe) was on the ground floor, so we couldn't leave the window open (no security screen or bars on the window frame). Even after two quick showers the room was unpleasantly humid.   The hotel is reasonably well located, it felt safe and clean. However, we had the opportunity to go back there (on our second stay in Antigua) and we did not go back.  \", 'Excellent location.  Room is spotless.  Sheets on bed were embroderied.  Courtyard is beautiful.  It reminded me of a New Orleans secret garden.  Bathroom is very tiny, with just enough room to move.  Very safe and friendly staff.  Minimal english spoken, yet very helpful. It will definately be the place we stay on our next visit.', \"I was made to feel very welcome in this charming hotel near the main square in Antigua. Built around a small center courtyard, my room was small, but fine for one or two persons. My only complaint would be the lack of sunlight in the room, but that is due to the courtyard style building. This makes the room great for taking naps because it's so dark! The roof top garden was a great place for breakfast and a glass of wine in the afternoon or evening to watch the sunset or stargaze. The staff was very friendly and helpful.\", 'Really enjoyed our stay here. Stayed in a canopy cabin which was cosy and fun and good value for money. Breakfast and lunch were fantastic, smoothies and burgers to die for. One evening meal was outstanding, the other which was cooked by some local women whilst the chef had a day off was a bit disappointing but overall really enjoyed eating ‘family style’ around the table. Not tonnes to do here, we found one full day here more than enough. Yoga was fantastic and we went for a walk ourselves using a map the lodge provided. Staff really lovely and friendly. Overall really recommend for a night or two. ', \"Wonderful and pleasant hotel in beautiful Antigua.  Perfect location, easy access, friendly and professional staff.

It was very close to La Merced (beautiful, yellow church) and several restaurants. We liked that it was a few blocks off central park, because it prompted us to do more walking and exploring for places to eat and shop. The staff were very friendly and set up a shuttle to Lake Atitlan for $10 usd/person with a pick up at the hotel, very convenient.   We chose a room on the third floor, #14, for the view of the volcano and the proximity to the rooftop terrace, which we used to watch the sunrise.

It gets a little loud on the pool side during the weekends so if you need to sleep in during a Saturday or Sunday make sure you request a room NOT facing the pool.  The only meal I had at the hotel was breakfast and the menu is robust.  On the weekends they have a delicious typical Guatemalan cuisine buffet.

Extremely expensive hotel for what it actually is. Dont get my wrong, it is a nice hotel, just overpriced.   I will be making a different review for the restaurant service which I would probably give 1 star out of 10 if possible. The included breakfast took forever, probably more than an hour (for a tomato and cheese omelet with beans and plantains). And the eggs were cold.

The woman at the front spoke perfect English and wished for a fast recovery. It was exactly what I needed when I was sick. The room was lovely, comfy bed, and hot water. We found the room quiet as well. We were on the second floor, I think if you were on the ground floor it may be more noisy because the eating area is right in the middle of everything and open.

The noice echoes like crazy in this hotel and it gets extremely noisy whenever anyone is walking around or talking outside their rooms. Even with earplugs in it wakes me up every night and morning. The rooms do not have windows to the outside, which can't be helped, but with the dark and outdated decor the darkness especially during a sunny day seems magnified somehow.\", 'This is a very beautiful hotel, with clean rooms, comfortable beds, and warm showers.  The courtyard is graced with beautiful gardens with a fountain in the middle, and it exudes a quiet and quaint atmosphere.  The staff is very helpful, and handled the ground transports not only to and from the airport, but also our transports to and from another city in Guatemala several hours away for our days spent there.  The hotel is only a two-block walk to the central square in Antigua--also a plus.  The rooms adjacent to the street can be a bit noisy if you wish to leave the windows open at all.  Windows along the sides do not have this problem.  We had stayed at Hotel Aurora once previous to this visit, and enjoyed our stay with them again this year.  We definitely recommend this hotel.', \"Unlike others, I did not find the garden gorgeous. It looked a bit unkempt to me, with little sense of design. The hotel is fine, and the location is excellent. Breakfast (continental)decent, although a hot dish costs extra. Rooms a bit old fashioned, but comfortable. Be aware they are grouped around the central courtyard and one morning I could hear voices outside from around 0700h.

I stayed at the hostal for 4 days and it helped add to the experience in Guatemala.  Very clean and cosy and will definitely stay here again if I return to Antigua.', 'In the La Merced church area of town - quite a good position. Our room looked a great deal smaller than the photo shown on the TripAdvisor website. It was a nice room, well-appointed, small. We arrived here the first time in Antigua after a very long day to find there was a problem with our booking - we still do not know who was at fault (our tour operator or the hotel?) and a different hotel had to be found. The hotel was helpful in this process. We could not stay the next 2 nights either but we were more than happy with our upgrade to El Convento (see separate review). We returned here at the end of our trip in Gutaemala. Our stay then was pleasant but only rates the 3 star I have given it as it was comfortable but nothing special and next morning our breakfast was VERY SLOW!', 'This is a small hotel in a good location. Its cute and clean. Has great and friendly staff that were really helpful. Stayed here for 4 nights but our room was next to the patio, where breakfast is served. This was the only negative as we can hear people early in the morning. But overall our stay here was great!

We were given a spacious clean room upstairs (205) which had access to a cute little terrace with table and chairs. This also had a view of the Fuego volcano! Breakfast was good with great coffee and the staff were also very friendly and helpful. The location is good, within walking to distance to the main square and also near the church with street food in the evenings. The only negative was that our room was adjacent to the road and above reception and we would be woken up quite early with noises from both areas.', \"I stayed at this hotel recently and enjoyed my stay for the most part, but this hotel has gone down in status and quality since the 90's when it was one of the best hotels in Central America in my opinion.  Formerly getting all the high end traffic in Antigua, that clientele now goes to the Case Santo Domingo that is 4 star now after its extensive renovation of an old Monastery.   No real complaints but just kind of sad to see it getting old and run down, but much better than a few years ago when they were using zip ties to secure women's purses when you sat in the restaurant.  Bad crime.   Parking is a pain in the rear if you have car as the parking area is a few blocks away from the hotel. Not good and frankly dangerous.    And, the shuttle to the airport is offered at 50\", 'My wife and I spent two weeks in this hotel using Antigua as a base. As we booked at the last minute it was the only one available near the city centre. Location near the central area is important in Antigua as you will be able to walk to just about everything you will want to do, and Naif is well located. It is a building perhaps some 20 years old built in a colonial Spanish style with galleries and a courtyard. We understood that it had only just been reopened after having been closed and improvements were being made during our stay. We had a large room with two queen sized beds and ensuite with shower. Our room had nowhere to store our clothes but they added a closet and an additional lamp to improve the lighting. Breakfast was served outside in the courtyard from a limited', \"This hotel is located in a nice, quite and central location. The rooms are good, clean and with hot water. Unfortunately, I did not have the best experience with the manager/owner. She was extremely rude and unprofessional and got really mad because we decided to book a shuttle to San Pedro through a travel agency and not through her. She said she had already put money down as a deposit on our behalf even though we hadn't paid her yet. She said she had used money out of her own pocket and since she couldn't cancel it and get her money back, we would have to pay at least half.  I felt really bad about the miscommunication so I apologized but explained that we hadn't made a commitment to go through her. Anyway, she went on to say that we needed to grow up and learn to take\", 'We had a good stay with 10 dutch girls at the earthlodge. The view is amazing and the accommodation is wonderful. The staff could be a bit nices and the service a bit better. We had to wait for our lunch for a long time and the girl who gave us a yogalesson was not so cheerful. Although a wonderful place to go to!

I have stayed here many times and will do so again.  I do have two suggestions:  1.  I think that you can afford to replace the \"back shoelaced\" chairs on the terrace!  They are very uncomfortable.  2.

The tour was fine, the guide tells you very interesting things about the coffee process, from harvesting to the cup. They transported us around the plantation in a big truck like we were in Jurassic Park, which for me it is more to create the feeling of a exotic excursion which is not. Then, they offer you a coffee cup, with the restriction of choosing between an expresso or americano. Perhaps the milk is that expensive in Antigua that they can't offer cappuccinos???   Then, the lunch which was a joke: chicken broth as an entrance, chicken with rice, salad and tortillas as the main and a lemon juice as the beverage, not even a soda!!! We paid almost almost 20 dollars for a lunch that we could have easily\", 'This is a great all inclusive place. It has a hotel, restaurant, bar and gallery. I attended a reception at the gallery for a great and talented artist. The reception was held on an open terrace, which was absolutely beautiful. The gallery itself was indoors, a bit small but very beautiful. The artist was available to meet and it was a very nice experience. The staff invited me to look at the restaurant area, as I had family that would be visiting me. It is a magnificent restaurant. Its very big and extremely elegant.

Nobody told me what time breakfast was - I had to guess. Nobody gave me a map or told me any useful information about events that week - it's Semana Santa and there are loads of events on - at least a map would have been useful or some local recommendations.

A nice old building spoiled by nasty upper floor additions. Very odd rooms upstairs with no windows other than high level strips - turned one of these down for another which smelled musty - damp in the walls or in the cheap thin carpet - but we didn't notice that after an hour or so.

We mentioned our concerns to the front desk and they kindly apologized and said they were unable to move us since they did not have a room large enough for us (there were 3 of us and we needed 3 beds) the first night, but they would have one the next night. Without even asking, they offered to move all of our luggage for us the next day to the new room. I was impressed by that! We stayed the first night and once we closed the windows and the shutters, the room was actually VERY quiet! They did bring us a fan the second night and that helped cut down the noise too.

The rooms themselves have a TV (ours with no remote, no huge deal in that we weren't in our room much), modern shower and bath fixtures (hot water was negligible in the afternoons). The beds were comfortable. Our room had a writing desk and wardrobe. Street noise was noticeable, but not too bad. If you are looking for absolute silence it might be a tough night for you.

Not the cheapest, but certainly not the most expensive.  The Aurora has large comfortable rooms that are well appointed.  The bathrooms are top notch.  They have an inner courtyard/garden that is a perfect place to spend some down time.  Well located and a five minute walk to the main square.  Limited parking, but parking.

If you are looking for a comfortable and attractive place to spend your time in Antigua, then this has to be on your list.', 'We spent three very comfortable nights here. The interior courtyard is gorgeous and so relaxing. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and everyone at the hotel was very nice. They arranged for a taxi to pick us up at Guatemala and bring us to the hotel very late on Christmas night and met us graciously well after midnight. There is ambient noise because the hotel is in the middle of a city, but it was really as quiet as could be expected.

I think the first night, we were the only guests. It is very secure, with the door always locked, but staff at the ready to unlock for the guests. Not on the street: it is about a half-block inside a compound. The one disadvantage is that it is about six blocks from the center square, and consequently not a place if you want to be in the center of the activity. The first two blocks of walking to the square is on a section of street with a non-existent sidewalk, but that street is not very busy.   The address is difficult to find. The hotel should make sure to provide directions on the website.', \"I was really pleased with the location which during the festivities of Semana Santa gave us a quite escape from all the crowds and commotion.

Perfect place if you want to be able to go out and enjoy the nightlife, but head home to somewhere a little quieter for a good night's sleep.

After a few hours there, I could see that they do not take care of much. They barely clean the rooms between customers ( there was sand in my bed, meaning they probably didnt change the cover) the shared bath is disgusting. After a trek I didnt even wanted to get in there because it was so dirty. I see the two employees at the gate all day doing nothing and they are not friendly for much.

The dorm room was simple, three bunk beds, a small desk, a small table.  There are two bathrooms in the hostel (I think a couple of the rooms have a private bathroom, but the rest of us shared the two general bathrooms.  Both have showers with the typical Guatemalan electric shower head.  There is also a shared kitchen (also very simple), and  a lovely back garden with some tables, chairs, and hammocks.

Our group included four adults, 2 young adults (18-20 years) and 4 children (3-15 years). Hotel Casa Cristina is located just a few blocks from La Merced and just a few blocks more to the central square. The rooms are simple, but very clean. The only downside is that the rooms open to the hallway instead of to a central courtyard; so there are no views, it can be noisy if people are talking outside of your room, and it's a bit stuffy when the windows are closed. However, this is reflected in the price, which is very affordable. The owners and staff were exceptionally kind and helpful.

Like many of the mid-level hotels in Antigua, the front door to the hotel was always locked requiring you to knock to gain entry. This gave a feeling of safety, so we were not expecting to have stanger attempt to break in to our room. My husband and I returned to the hotel in the evening with friends and decided to enojy some additional time on the roof-top patio. One person in our party went downstairs and discovered a woman attempting to get in to our room (luckily we had locked it).

The driver took me to the hotel and was most courteous.  All of the staff at Posada are so nice.  I will go back again.  Their rooms are small but immaculate and you cannot beat the friendly bilingual staff.

The aesthetics of the courtyard are nice, but the hotel leaves much to be desired.  - Virtually no sound privacy in the room. We had to listen to our neighbors' baby, to our other neighbors having sex at 3 am, and to every person walking by the room outside sounding like they were practically in our room. This was a major problem for us.  - Inconsistent / non-existent water pressure and hot water.  For $140/night, I'd like predictable water.

Of course, there are fresh samples and opportunities to purchase at the end! The tour involved a large truck that drove us at most a mile up a slight hill, so that part of the tour is a bit overrated and probably causes it to cost more than it might otherwise.

The hotel has conference space and was utilized nearly every day for some events including fiestas late into the evening.

We were greeted warmly and invited to dine outdoors or in. We ordered a salad (VERY TASTY!) and a burger.

A relatively quiet hostel (unless staying on the ground floor when breakfast is served) and a lovely place to relax after a day spent exploring the town. 100%', \"They have good beds and pillows which is rare for this price range.

The beds were comfortable, although for that time of the year in Antigua, we were a little chilly in the room.  The private bathroom was small but most important, had hot water in the shower.  We paid Q100 per night for the room (total price for 2 persons).  My wife insists on a private bathroom and this is by far the best hotel for the price that we've found in Antigua.  (Certainly not the Marriot, but great for the price.)\", 'Just so others are aware....We stayed here for 2 nights in a private double room with a private bathroom. On our second day we noticed that $160US (that was hidden in our pack) had been stolen. The room was locked while we out so either the owner or one of the staff stole the money. The owner was less than helpful when we reported the stolen money.', \"We stayed here at the end of July 2015, and were woken on our first morning by marching bands outside our window for the 25th July celebrations.  Awesome way to see Antigua for the first time!!  The hotel is a beautiful old Spanish colonial style place, with a beautiful courtyard containing a massive garden and fountain. We stayed in room 7, which faced the main street although the double glazed window kept the noise level down.  The room was really small but very well appointed with a huge comfortable bed that occupied most of the room and lovely wooden furniture.    The ensuite bathroom was one of the smallest I've ever seen in my life - literally if you lean forward while using the facilities, you bump your head on the closed door - and was so small it didn't even have room\", \"I've stayed twice at Hotel Aurora, and I've passed along the name to all of my friends here in San Salvador for when they are in Antigua.

Good location.  Very helpful, friendly service.  Good, simple breakfast.  Wifi not great.', 'Stayed just one night..been to many hotels in Antigua.  Rooms clean and decorated nice, comfortable bed.  My only issue was the noise, heard conversations of other guests all night.  Otherwise,very friendly and helpful front desk, delicious breakfast, everyone I encountered was very nice.  I would definitely stay again', \"Si, this is indeed a cute boutique hotel with a great staff close to the main square but i was a bit dissapointed for the price. The entire hotel is quaint and the rooms have a monestary feel about them with the high ceilings and lack of natural light. One of the reasons i booked was for the hot tub on the roof with the view of the city; however, this turned out to be a two person bathtub that they refill for each use that only fills up half-way (due to a drain that has been installed) so that you are sitting in luke-warm water that only covers half of your torso. Also, it is located next to a popular bar and we could hear music through the walls late into the night. Absolutely acceptable accomodations but i'm surprised it is rated #1.\", \"My sister and I booked one of the inexpensive rooms for our stay in Antigua. We left Antigua, and went up through northern Guatemala, and liked Casa Cristina so much that we stayed again while passing through Antigua a second time.  Our room was simple but nice. We had been backpacking Central America and to us, Casa Cristina was a luxurious treat. The rooms we stayed in both had twin beds and lovely traditional-style blankets. The rooms had cabinets with extra blankets available, and cable TV. The bathrooms were nice and bright - with towels provided as well as soap. The walls are a bit thin, and we did sometimes hear other people (voices) but other guests were respectful and we didn't find it was excessively loud. The rooms on the main floor that we stayed in did not have\", 'I can honestly say that there was nothing I liked about this place.  Except maybe the part where I checked-out, never to return.  From the outside, the place looks quite nice and historic.  However, the minute we got to our room I knew we were in trouble.  Most of the rooms only have windows onto the central patio- which means that not only are they very dark, but the noise level approaches circus-like at most times of the day and night.  If someone is walking by your room: you hear it.  If someone is talking in the room next door: you hear it.  If someone checks into the front desk: you hear it.  Good thing I was there with a good friend and not a significant other!  So forget resting in your room after a long day of touring or hiking- you will be woken up approximately every 7', 'What a lovely hotel!   A little oasis of peace, tranquility in a central location in the lovely city of Antigua. Clean, central, safe, beautiful courtyard, lovely roof terrace, helpful staff, self catering kitchen.  We stayed in a group of 13, so had various types of rooms including triples, quads, doubles, all from which there were no complaints.  I stayed at the hotel on two separate occasions (at the begining and end of our trip). The first stay, we had a quad - well really it fit 5 very comfortably. There were 2 separate bedrooms, plenty of space, a large clean bathroom and - best of all- we were looking onto the beautiful courtyard, full of flowers, and plants. It was so peaceful.

The rooms are basic but clean and have abundant hot water and water pressure. The staff is very courteous and helpful. The front door is always locked and you buzz to get in, so it seems quite secure. What makes it so attractive are the price ($40/night for my double room) , convenient location, and some very nice amenities for budget travelers. Coffee and free local breads are set out every morning. There is a common and well-equipped kitchen for the use of guests who want to prepare some or all of their meals.', 'the good: the property is beautiful and blends in with the culture. Nice rooftop view of the volcano. Staff is friendly. the bad: breakfast is pathetic. 2 eggs and a slice of fruit. no juice or anything else. far from the center. plan about a 15-20 min walk. Fine for a day but if your staying more than that it gets tiring, especially when you pass by other beautiful hotels much closer.

Service was friendly and excellent, the included breakfast was a nice surprise (although the repeated 2 choices were delicious, a bit more variety would have been welcomed), the bed was comfortable, and the bath was adequate.  Rooms were made up in good time, and were very clean.  While most of the time it was serenely quiet, limited construction went into the evening hours some nights, which was not as condicive to the otherwise lovely ambiance.

Rooftop access has great views including of Volcano Agua. Complimentary pure water in rooms. Sit down continental breakfast was had with a nice cup of coffee.  My evening was quiet and I slept well.  I would stay here again. Please note, I made my reservation with Booking.com.  When I arrived at the hotel, they had not charged my room.

Our room (11) had one of the most gorgeous bathrooms we've ever seen.  The room was very large and comfortable.  The rest of the hotel is equally beautiful.  The rooftop is very interesting:  lots of nooks, a turret, several areas to sit and admire the great view.  The breakfast room is both stunning and relaxing, a great place to start the day.  Blanca, the breakfast hostess was wonderful.    The biggest issue is noise.  You expect noise in any Central/South American city (firecrackers, roosters, etc.)  However, the hotel compound is well-insulated from outside noise; the noise comes from the hotel itself because of the way it is designed.

The rooftop terrace is stunning and every space is artfully and uniquely decorated.  What's strange, though, is that the rooms surround the restaurant so you literally have to walk by people eating to open the door to your room.  The bathroom literally shared a window and wall with the restaurant.  It was a little awkward at times, to say the least.    I should also note that, while this place isn't far from the center, it is kind of on the outskirts of the town.  Given, it's not a huge town, but I feel like I should mention it since we did comment on it when we were walking back one time. \", 'Excellent scenery, cannot write about the rooms because I did not stay however the restaurant service is very slow.  It was clear that the employees are not well organized when it comes to orders and stuff.  From the moment we ordered we had to wait around 40 minutes for our food to be prepared and served,  I think they should see this as an improvement opportunity since the food is really good and not to talk about the view from the restaurant.

When we returned the next to pay the third night we were told that the room had been already given to someone else and we would have to leave the hostel after the second night. We didn't hear any apologies from their side but rather were told we should have paid all three nights at once.

The hotel is situated within a couple of hundred metres of the Central plaza, however there are lots of other hotels equally close to the centre of town.  Rooms are situated  with the windows looking out onto a central courtyard, which is roofed.  Apparently it was quite noisy when it rained before the roof was installed.  The rooms were comfortable enough and the lack of air condiioning was not a problem.  A portable fan was available although we did not use it.  the room however was quite musty, although I did not find this to be objectionable and I consider it to be not unusual in an old colonial building with character.  Two main issues were the intermittent hot water, which we never came to terms with and the noise', 'My wife and I took a short term mission trip to Guatemala. We stayed at El Carmen.

Truly dismal. I think the rooms on the upper floors are better and have windows, but the ground floor rooms were noisy, old, worrying electrics, no privacy so the bathroom window opened onto the courtyard where breakfasts were served, damp, smelly, horrible and nylon sheets, eeughhh.

The delicious buffet breakfast has often started my days and I enjoy the very friendly and helpful staff at this hotel ~ many who have become good friends.

Some reviewers comment negatively about service but I cannot agree with this. Yes the hotelis not perfect and yes there is no pool on the roof.

Staff was very friendly and helped us out when we were mistakenly taken to the wrong hotel. Our room  were larger than expected and was comfortable for what we needed.  a nice courtyard allowed for some escape from the heat. the only negative, and its not major,  is based on the layout- our room was on the ground floor facing the courtyard, so we could hear people returning/leaving  their rooms at night, noisy conversations etc. again minor issue and nothing that impacted our stay in Antigua. wished we had a longer stay.', \"The people at Hotel El Carmen are incredibly helpful, kind, considerate--we much appreciated Paulino and Libny for their assistance during our ten-day stay. Breakfasts were great, the room was comfy (with the fan they provided) and were kept clean each day, and it was quiet at night. Its proximity to the park, to restaurants, to everything, was perfect.

Has a very pretty roof top area, with lovely views. Room was on the small side, but bed was extremely comfortable, with tv (cable) provided in rooms. We'd arrived at the hotel at 4am (from an overnight bus from Flores) and the poor gentleman who we'd woken up to check us in, did so with a smile on his face and in a very friendly manner! Only complaint would be that rooms unfortunately had no air-conditioner or fans. As the room windows looked into the interior of hotel (which was a big sun-room type of thing), the rooms became hot and stuffy towards the end of the day. Other than that, stay was hassle-free.

Positives - The room was not very clean (by first world standards), but still acceptable.  The included breakfast was decent.  The location is great - the middle of the town.  Negatives - Room windows face into the hotel not outside + no air conditioning = you get to hear all the noise in the hotel because your window is the only source of cool air.  The \"Hot Tub\" was never open and probably never has been used - although you will be charged for it on your  bill.  TV signal was garbage.

The photos on the expedia website are completely false.  First off, the hot tub on the roof has no water in it and it's probably because they are incapable of heating water properly.  We had no hot water during our three night stay there.  We also had to switch rooms because the carpet was so incredibly dirty that....well, it defies a reasonable explanation.  We were moved to a room close to the stairs to the roof that should probably be converted to storage because it is just feet away from where the staff are allowed to hang out so you can hear them talking constantly.

There is a rooftop terrace where you can't sit during daytime due to the burning sun. Overall: facilities do not service 16 people, sleeping quality is average, the place felt cramped.

We didn\\'t have much familiarity with them, but the bites were big and in the linear \"breafast-lunch-dinner\" pattern which is typical of bedbugs.   The room smelled musty.   We switched rooms on the third day, but it didn\\'t help.  The price we paid was on the high side for Guatemala, and should have been enough to pay for a clean room without bedbugs.', \"Antigua and this hotel were well worth the visit.    Not sure quite how it works but El Meson de Maria was across the road from Casa Antigua which is part of the same group and there was a restaurant next door which was also part of the group.   Didn't notice the paper thin walls and none of our group mentioned them either.    From the outside the hotel is just a double door and a sign on an ordinary street in this lovely colonial town.  Like lots of properties in the town behind the door was a beautiful courtyard open to the skies with rooms going off for 2 floors and a roof terrace with great views.

The service is very good, especially those provided by Manoel, who could find us a very nice tour to the Pacaya Volcano on late Sunday.  The garage is another great advantage of this hotel.  The only is remark is the breakfast that is very simple and could be improved by more options of bread.\", \"We stayed two nights. Previous reviews have pretty much covered it all.  We are an older couple and this hostel suited our needs well. It is quiet and clean, with conscientious staff and attracts a nice mix of affable travellers of all ages.

We did not drive, but I did see parking about 2 blocks (maximum) away from the hotel. Hotel itself is very small and quaint. We had two rooms (2 adults and 3 teens/pre-teens). One was the Master room which had a nice little patio on the roof that you accessed via a window. Room had an incredibly comfortable king bed, was very clean and was plenty big enough for the two of us.

I had a flight delay and they simply charged me and cancelled my reservation.

Beautiful roof top deck with lounge chairs, and tables with umbrella in a charming setting.  Breakfast is fresh fruit, bread and coffee.

Free high speed internet access a great plus.  Bring your iPhone!', \"We found the service here to be top-notch-equal to that of a much costlier hotel. It has only 6 rooms, so it's very small, but there's a lovely roof deck (including a hot tub) with incredible views of the surrounding volcanoes.

The only downside is that it is quite noisy, being one half block from the plaza, but many of the small hotels in the historic district share this disadvantage. Very safe and secure, as well as spotlessly clean.\", 'We stayed on the top floor (3 nights) which had amazing views of the surrounding volcanoes. The rooms were spacious.

They do have coffee and bread available for breakfast, but right around the corner there are bakeries with amazing pastries for cheap. It was a little bit from the city center, but it is a nice walk.

When we arrived we were told they didn't have a room for us and that we had to stay\", 'The room is comfortable, the environment is friendly and peaceful. The amenities are good but i think it could be better! This is one of the top hotels in Antigua Guatemala so i recommend it whit no problem!', 'We were welcomed very well as a group of 12 people. Friendly, comfortable, nice view on the roof-terrace, kitchen use was great. Rooms and beds in pretty good shape, it was rather hot though (the fan was not enough). The hostel employee was really nice in helping us buy beer from the neighbours and helped us get a sim-card.', 'We stayed here in October 2016. Three of us crash in a room on the first floor, each with our own bed and the room came with two fans and breakfast in the morning. The breakfast was an omelet bar and \"pancake\" bar. The rooms are clean and neat, although quite basic. It\\'s not a luxury spot by any means but does the trick! After hours, they have a security guard at the locked gate.  They have a nice roof deck area where you can drink beers or enjoy that breakfast. It\\'s an easy walk from most attractions in the area.  Can\\'t quite recall the prices (should be online) but it was fair! Would recommend it.', 'I was stuffed in a room next to the garden, heard fighting cats at 4am, my fiance heard people having sex the whole night keeping her awake, and the service for the breakfast was nonexistent. For 85.00 a night this place was highway robbery, would not pay 30.00 for a night for there, never going back,', 'I stayed for a night on this hotel, as I had a wedding in Antigua. It was my first time. When you walk in the sight is beautiful. The staff is very nice and helpful. The only \"but\" I have is that the rooms are too small. Incredibly small. Almost no place to put the bags, and we didn´t had big ones because we were just for one night. I have to admit I only saw the double rooms, so I don´t know if the single room at least feels bigger. The bathroom was clean, but is already a bit old and no hot water in the shower. Also something that I have to say is that because all the windows overlook the hallway and the center \"patio\", you can hear the carts of the cleaning ladies and all the wheels from other guests luggage, which at 7am is not a nice thing to hear. The hotel is not cheap,', \"The rooms are clean and nicely furnished. Grounds are beautful. It's quiet. BUT - the rooms smell damp, they are cold, and worst of all, the water in the shower is tepid at best. We stayed here one night. Were told the system is brand new and they didn't know why it didn't work. Two days later we came back and were given a different room. Tested the water before we decided to stay. Yep, still tepid. The manager insisted it was hot and was not very happy. We left and went to El Meson de Maria. A much better experience there.\", 'Great location but this hotel was a BIG disappointment.  Our interior room was TINY and HOT.  They had no fans, and only one light on the side of the bed.  The safe was not locked down.  You could hear the noises from other guests all night long.   The staff was not very helpful and the breakfast was only fruit and coffee.  I would never come back here.   ', 'We spent a total of three nights at this hotel and really liked the comfortable beds and clean rooms. Our room was on the main level, but it was not noisy at all (nope, no rooster or barking dogs!!!). Breakfast was served every morning with some breads, fruit salad, juice and coffee, which was fine for us. The location was perfect, only two blocks from some of the main attractions in this amazing town. Staff were very friendly as well. The only \"minus\" I have for this place is that the rooms were a bit smallish for the price, but once again, they were super clean and comfortable.  Antigua is such a great place to visit, we wish we could have stayed longer!! I recommend Hotel Lo De Bernal.', 'Small hotel, rooms are nice, if you can choose, choose second floor, first is noisy. Is 2 blocks away main street, so you can walk everywere. Breakfast is not really breakfast, just eggs ans cereal, but you can easily find something to eat in the area', \"This is a cute little hotel with a few rooms.. A small courtyard with paintings, vines, hanging plants and benches greets you as you enter. The rooms are modest but clean and comfortable. Just be sure *not* to stay in Room 5 - there is a foul sewage smell in the pipes of the bathroom in that room that is always in the bedroom as well. It is extremely unpleasant and shouldn't even be offered as an option.   The breakfast is a modest affair and portion sizes are Guatemalan (as opposed to North American) which suited us fine though was initially surprising. Both the continental and traditional breakfasts are good. The people at the desk and in the kitchen are friendly and sweet. They do not, however, speak much English, so carry a good phrasebook if Spanish is not your strong suit.\", \"I spent one night at this hotel and yes it is centrally located, and the daytime managers are helpful, but the place is noisy. You hear every footstep, every door slammed, every voice. Sort of an echo chamber. The rooms are clean but I slept horribly, and checked out 2 days earlier than planned. If noise doesn't bother you this place is a good choice, if you're on a budget. However, for an extra ten bucks you can do far better around the corner. Certainly, it did not live up to the sterling reviews posted in my opinion. The night manager was not very nice either.\", \"We had two rooms here (1 double and 1 single) for 2 nights in mid December 2013.  The place was very clean and the rooms were simple but nice.  The lights were kept off in the hallway during the evening which made the guest house feel quite dark!  The price is right for this place!  It is very close to the Park Central which was nice.  The rooftop terrace was a little rustic, it wouldn't take much to spruce it up a bit!\", 'We stayed at Hotel Casa Cristina for a total of seven days.  All the staff were friendly and very helpful.  The rooms are clean and comfortable.  The roof terrace is a splendid facility which we enjoyed very much.  Some of the rooms are on the small side, and because the corridors are tiled, they can be quite noisy (especially as other travellers walk around early in the mornings to go on tours etc..)  The rooms also largely only have windows on to the corridor section and so this means you cannot open windows at night - this would be very noisy.  Antigua is a wonderful city, the location of Casa Cristina is perfect (away from the hustle and bustle but not too far!).  New Year is a great time to visit this city.', \"We stayed in the Habitación Delux King with garden view. It is decorated very charmingly, is very comfortable and has enough space, also for travel bags. There is a safe and a private bathroom. Breakfast is served on the rooftop with great views on the vulcanos. The terrace is very peaceful with flowers en fruit plants. All of the staff is very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is a little out of the center, but with a tuktuk you'll be home in no time after a late night dinner.\", 'Tops: quiet spot, excellent breakfast view from the terrace, security,  good hosts Downs: the room was not very clean, toilet was dated and furniture full of dust. It is a shame because all other aspects would have 5 stars.', 'This is a very convenient and friendly hotel in a lovely old house. Breakfast on the roof terrace admiring the view and in particular the nearby volcanoes. Very friendly staff, particularly the night porter who is charming and helpful.. Sadly our room was dark and the only windows opened onto the side of the courtyard which was the main passageway through the hotel; therefore light and privacy a problem. Minor disturbances . from the water feature just by the door which started up at about 7am daily and noisy machinery in a cupboard by the other end of the room. However, do not be put off.- it is a really charming spot', 'This hotel was right at the main square/park in central Antigua. Felt very safe. Staff was extremely nice and speaks English which was a plus for a traveler with limited Spanish. Rooms were beautiful and clean. Give it a try!', 'We visited the plantation with large group of high school students. There are several activities available including zip lines, mules rides and coffee plantation tours. There is also a nice open air restaurant available. This excursion was definitely a hit with the teens. The food was great and the coffee is outstanding. The grounds are beautiful and meticulously maintained. ', \"The Aurora hotel is a pleasant hotel. The rooms are spacious, the beds very comfortable, and overall very clean and tidy. The courtyard is well mantained and their flowers are wonderful.   What I found discomforting was the fact  because the rooms are all facing the inner courtyard (which is public space) then you can't open the only windows to let air in without being totally exposed.   The continental breakfast incuded in the price was not great, except for the few fruits, the rest was just.. average... good thing Antigua is full of great restaurants ! And the staff is also considerate of those wanting to save a buck or two by using their microwave/fridge.  In all I would recommend this hotel, nothing extravagant or pretentious, it is pleasant. But not for a long stay because\", 'My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights on a 3 week vacation to explore antigua. The hotels location is really good, near all the good spots and walking distance to everywhere  you need to visit. It was easy to find and the place is beautiful. The courtyard  in the middle is beautiful and well maintained. Check in was easy and prompt. The staff are very friendly.   The room in itself was quite nice. Large king bed and the bathroom  was clean and well maintained. We had some plumbing issues the first night but the hotel staff fixed that so quickly! They could really improve on the lighting inside the room tho, so dark and no sunlight came through.   There are some great restauraunts out front and very convenient. Overall if youre looking for convenience and budget friendly', 'Earth Lodge is a one of a kind place that is truly worth a visit! The treehouse style cabins are so cosy to stay in, the views are out of this world and they have some great hiking trails! Set on an avocado farm, it was so amazing to wake up and see so many fresh fruits and beautiful plants around the grounds. The hammocks are so relaxing and you can sit out and play their many board games. We also did yoga in the morning which was incredible overlooking the mountains.  The only reason this gets 4 stars is that the food was a bit disappointing. I was so looking forward to the family style local vegetarian food. In reality it was a very average stir fry with too much soy sauce. I love that they make their own homemade sauces etc but it lets them down when they then use store', 'It is not worth to visit this place. Firstable the road is dangerous and cannot take 2 cars. During rains, you might see mud slices. Upon in location, service and cleaness is poor. The are better places around that location.', \"My daughter and I spent one night at Earth Lodge and staying in the tree house.  Our 24 hours at the lodge were truly priceless.  We were surrounded by nature, 350 avocado trees, 3 volcanos, and friendly people.  We took advantage of the morning yoga class which was great and very much enjoyed the family style meal in the evening and the fresh breakfast in the morning. There's something quite magical about spending the night in a tree house.  Definitely worth a visit for those traveling to Antigua with an appreciation for nature.  \", 'The hotel was very beautiful and had an old world feel to it.  The beds were comfortable, rooms clean, setting was quiet.  Did not always have hot or even warm water in the shower.', 'The location is very good. Some staffs are not English-speaking, but all of them are very nice and helpful. The dogs are very very cute, especially lucky.', \"I liked this place. Tanya was extremely pleasant and helpful with all kinds of things, the hostel was really quiet after 10:30pm, and there are two communal spaces where you can chat to other travellers (one of which is a roof terrace with nice views of the mountains). The bed was lumpy as another reviewer has commented but it wasn't uncomfortable to sleep on. \", 'Although the rooms were nice, they lacked air conditioning which made it extremely uncomfortable to be in.  The breakfast area had Sunny Delight instead of Orange Juice and did not have enough choices on hot sauce. It took forever for them to find a small bottle of Tabasco.

I stayed just one night, but I need stay two nights for enjoy more of the Soleil and the great place named Antigua Guatemala', 'We stayed here last week and enjoyed the walkability of the town. The concierge was wonderful in helping us get dinner reservations. The accessibility of A La Carta Tours is convenient to plan the tours. If you are a light sleeper, take ear plugs. The rooms are located on the periphery of the property which is just inside the walls that border the roads. The rooms are well appointed but the turn down service was unpredictable. The bathroom amenities are wonderful. When El Fuego erupted, it was visible from the poolside. Eat your meals elsewhere. The breakfast buffet is expensive without the food warranting it. You can walk into town and have a similar breakfast for 1/4 the price and probably with better service. It was surprising that they did not even tell us that they had an a', 'Really Nice place, breakfast is amazing and location is good! Shared toilets and showers that may be crowded in the morning, but nice and clean! Arranges many tours from the reception at fair prices (the coffee tour at 150q was good)', \"Hotel is very nice and in a good location you walk 7 blocks to the main strip where all the bars and clubs are. Wont be necessary for a taxi I didn't take one while  there for a weekend. If your going to Antigua stay at this spot its a safe neighborhood. Don't use the tour guides the hotel provides its bit of a rip off but if your there to party and drink Mono Loco is 2.5  blocks right then 5 blocks right.\", 'They have the most confortable beds I have ever slept in!! Also the hotel is very cozy and well located, near the Calle del Arco. I would totally stay there again.', \"We stayed here for one night in January at the end of our trip, when we unexpectedly decided to come back to Antigua and our original hotel was booked up. We weren't expecting much, but I was quite surprised by how nice it was given the rate. I didn't hear the roosters that previous reviewers complained of, in fact, I slept better here than at Posada de Don Rodrigo due to it's slightly less central location and no traffic noise.   Postives Small inn with boutique feel, including cute courtyard on both lower and upper levels. Staff spoke enough English that it was never awkward. Nice sized rooms, comfy beds, impecabbly clean, modern amenities but with quaint Guatemalan charm like wood beams. Wifi that always worked, even on the second level, farthest from lobby. Negatives No\", 'I\\'m sitting at the lobby waiting for our ride back to the airport and I am still in awe of this hotel and the beauty and charm of Antigua.   My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights and not once were we bothered by noise. This is a very quaint B&B. Only 9 rooms and very private. The staff were excellent and ready to answer and help us in any way despite our \"poquito\" Espanol.   Our room (103) was a bit small but this did not bother me or my partner at all. Though the bathroom did not have a tub, the shower area was roomy and hot water abundant! We slept peacefully and the beddings were very comfortable.   Breakfast was adequate. Fresh fruits and made to order eggs (for an extra $1 and well worth it!) coupled with toast and Guatemalan coffee (yum!) or tea. We suggest adding', \"Having read another review that mentioned the crowing cockerel we tried to book another hotel with the travel agent, but were unable to do so for the first night of our stay in Antigua. All I can say is thank God we didn't have to spend all our four nights here! The cockerel first started to crow just after midnight and then off and on for the rest of the night.  A shame as the room was a good size and quite comfortable. The breakfast was continental style, but adequate. Free wifi. Overall I do feel sorry for the owners misfortune to be living next door to such a noisy bird!\", 'we have reservations that say to contact the hotel to arrange arrival and shuttle but calling the person only speaks Spanish and there is no email address. i see very good reviews but how are you all getting in touch with them?', 'It is difficult to find a good place in Guatemala for around $30.  Casa Cristina is a good solution if that is your budget and you want a private room and bathroom in a central location.  It is very basic and no frills. Bathroom is outdated and small but clean and hot showers.  Bed is not the most comfortable but it is suitable for a night or two.  Nothing to rave about here, but it is a reliable budget/value hotel.  We booked online and paid our deposit through paypal.  When we arrived, the man did not speak English but he understood my limited Spanish and showed us a few rooms before we decided on the first floor room. We needed a place to shower and crash in between transfers so this suited our needs just fine.', 'People complain about the rooms being small. I found them fine. We first stayed in the best rooms and next visit regular room. I found regular rooms on second floor just fine. Having a view of the volcano from a small window is not worth the extra $. Just get on their roof too patio and get your view. Avoid downstairs rooms 1 and 2 as they are close to reception and outside. We had room 7 perfect. ', 'I have stayed here 2 times in the last 12 months and find this place consistant and wonderful!  There is new ownership or management in the past year or so and they have upgraded everything!  They added a 2 story suite which I am anxious to stay in but it is always occupied!  The people running this place are really working hard at making this one of the best places to stay!  The desk speaks English.  They have a rooftop observation, eating and sunning area that is great for relaxing.  The price of these rooms is a real bargain compared to some in town.  Oh yes...they will VALET your vehicle to a secure private parking lot 2 blocks away...the price is a tip to the bellman!', 'After heavy rains and landslides made us put off our trip to the Salvadoran coast, we decided to pay yet another visit to Antigua.  This was our first time at Hotel Los Pasos---and we were happy with our choice!  The room was clean and comfortable, and the location was just a few blocks off the beaten path.  We enjoyed a complimentary full breakfast up on the rooftop terrace one morning, and in the quaint dining room the next.  The hotel courtyards and gardens are lovely, and the hotel is very secure.  After more than a year in Guatemala, we never tire of our visits to Antigua.  We will definitely return to Hotel Los Pasos in the future!', 'There were some bad things and good things about this hotel, I will start with the bad. When I got there my room did not have a TV and the phone did not work. They move me to another room, but a lot the rooms had very tiny tv’s and they did not work or had terrible reception. They close the doors of the hotel at 10 Pm so when you come after this time you have to bang on the door and hope they hear you. I ask for wake up calls the first one they got right the other time they did not call me, no apology was offer by the crew. They will charge you for the internet service wether you use it or not. The towels are old and need to be replace. Their tourist brochure’s are terrible, and the ones they do have are not that good. For the price of $50 dollars a night this was overprice, for', \"The location is good, just a couple of blocks from the park. Rooms are clean, but I found the mattress to be a bit hard. No box spring. The room we stayed in had high ceilings and was nice enough, but could have used lower windows as they were 10 ft. from the floor, felt a bit stuffy. They charge for local calls, I believe it was 1Q per minute, which I found to be a bit much. Had a problem when checking out as they double dipped my credit card, didn't find out until the statement came in the mail. Visa International took care of it, but it took about 6 months. It was probably unintentional, as the people were very nice. Spanish colonial interior courtyeard type setting. Very pretty. Anything over $US50 per night might be a bit much for this hotel, unless it's during the holiday\", 'Situated on the edge of town ( this is ideal as it is quieter at night) The Casa Florencia is a nice hotel. Pretty garden terrace with chairs. We were in the downstairs rooms , which was a shame as they are quite dark and you don’t get the lovely views as you do from upstairs. The rooms, although small and basic, were very clean, hot showers, and the beds were hard but okay. I did request an extra pillow, which was no trouble at all. 24 hour reception, very friendly owners and very helpful with arranging shuttles etc. Easy walking distance to the market, the central plaza and shops and restaurants. Would definitely recommend. Be aware they only accept cash, not cards, fairly typical in this part of Guatemala.', 'The place is gorgeous,like an Italian villa; food was very good; service also ver good; heated pool- great for kids!

Best decision ever.  The hike down form the \"parking lot\", not so bad--the hike up is challenging especially if you are not used to any altitude.  The setting is magnificent, however the views are best from the lodge as so much greenery around the casa rooms you cannot see out the windows.  Seating for meals is shared tables wih other guests which can be great if you connect with like minded guests which we did not.

The rooms were nice, clean, well kept, yet cramped. Honestly, for over $250 a night, I expected at least some closet space.  All they had was a small wardrobe.  The staff was unfailingly polite, and although I believe they need training, their attitude made up for any shortcomings.  Request... please remove the piano from the hallway.  Believe me, it was no fun being awakened at 6 am on New Year's day by a 5 year old thinking he was Beethoven, with the parents nowhere to be seen.

Staff are super helpful with booking transportation etc, breakfast is good and showers are warm. My favourite thing about this place though is the beautifully decorated rooms. A few minor issues are pretty small rooms, and if you are in a room by the terrace you will hear everything that goes on out there - not that this is a party hostel at all, but if people are up early eating/talking you will hear it. Also toilets and showers are downstairs so a small walk, not an issue for me but worth noting. Best wifi we had in the whole of Guatemala. Great option.', \"This place has a nicely chill vibe. The roof terrace was my favourite reading spot in Antigua! :D The breakfast was also a real scoop - certainly the best one I had in Guatemala!

It’s functional but not very comfortable. Like most of the hotels in Antigua, hot water is only available in the shower, not the sink. It has a shower stall crowded into one corner and the water from it splashes under the shower curtain to make a mess on the bathroom floor.

He is next door evidently, but it feels like he's right in the room with you.  For $140 a night, it's ridiculous that we couldn't get a good night's sleep because of this.  I asked the front desk if there is anything they could do, but they said they didn't know where the rooster was and that it was a neighborhood one with no home (though I sincerely doubt that).

We stayed in the master suite and were very pleased.  It was spacious, finely appointed with a large bathroom and extra large shower.  The bed was incredibly soft.

We booked a one day excursion to Tikal which required a 4am departure.  I was blown away', \"We had high hopes for this hotel after reading the review and seeing the photos.  Our room was tiny but I had heard the 2nd floor was quieter, so we compromised on this...  still there was a barking dog that kept us awake truly throughout the night.  I even went down to the front desk and they couldn't really do anything about it.... also the internet connection was very slow.   very disappointing.  :(\", \"This hotel was horrible because you can't sleep at night because of the rooster that lives next door.  My wife and I decided to stay here after reading the reviews on tripadvisor.  I have a little less faith in tripadvisor after staying here.  Not sure how people didn't mention the rooster that started crowing at 3:30AM both nights we stayed there.  I say started, because it would resume crowing about every 20-30 minutes all the way until about 6:30AM.  It was horrible!!!!  The deal is, there's a family that lives next door to the hotel, and they have a bunch of farm animals in their back yard.  We complained after the first night and the hotel management said they couldn't do anything about the neighbors animals.  After the second night of it happening we demanded that they\", \"Amazingly beautiful hotel-- 400+ years old, but nice rooms. Check out the picture of the keys-- 400 year old locks too.

The staff were very professional, courteous and helped alleviate our anxiety and stress during the event.

They have fireplaces, wood beams, and feel a bit like stepping into a colonial room. The amenities are not updated, but the shower had good pressure and everything worked and was clean. The water filter in the rooms is a nice touch I thought. The hotel is probably one of the biggest in Antigua so the rest of the facility, while nice, lacks some of the charm of the smaller boutique hotels around. Staff were very nice and tried to be helpful, but they answered questions inconsistently about things like transport prices. One of the biggest downsides is the internet. Most room rates include free wifi, but it is only for one device and you have to pay $5 a day for each additional device. Not a fortune, but it was', 'Very old hotel.  The hotel has not been renovated in a while.   The pictures of the rooms are not real.  The bedding is old and the room has humidity in the walls.  For the high price, I would recommend stay at other boutique hotels in Antigua.', \"They gave me a room with bad pipes, blamed the volcano for the dirty water, and were irresponsible for letting me bath with this water.

They replace it, but when I checked-out they charged US 8.00 for Internet, and didn't said they were charging that.\", 'The place is a win for backpakers! The couple running the place is kind and helpful, we had a great stay! The bed was enormous, kitchen nice, people kind.

They helped me out and give me soup.   The roof terrace has a amazing view. The hostel is clean.   But not quite in the evening the neighbours make a lot of noise.   Then i didn't feel safe at a point. The owner and staffmember got in to a fight. Words and was going on very agressive from my point of view. All because of not trusting her staffmember and her own lost keys. (she found them)  She didn't got up the next morning so i didn't see her anymore.  The other owner was sleeping so didn't know what was going on.  \", 'My daughter and I travel to Guatemala pretty frequently and before we started a project i wanted to have a sort of different experience and we spent a day and a night at the Earth Lodge.

We really enjoyed our stay!', 'Stayed in the tree house at earth lodge and it was a great experience. Waking up to the sound and sight of volcano fuego erupting was unbelievable. The view alone is worth the price of the room. Beds were very comfortable and it was nice to have a real pillow for once in Central America. The only reason I gave this 4 and not 5 was due to one of the staff members being a bit rude and unpleasant. She made it feel as though you were bothering her if you ordered a drink or food.  But other then that the rest of the staff were amazing. Would come back in a heart beat.  Wifi was only available during the day in the common areas and the dinners were served family style which was a nice way to meet people.', 'The following is a copy of an email I sent to the manager which explains our situation. Although I never made it to earthlodge I will NEVER be going after what happened to us.  \"As evidenced by the email chain I had booked, confirmed, and paid for one night in your lodge. Due to unforeseen traffic it took us many extra hours to arrive to Antigua from the lake and I had no cell phone service. As soon as we arrived we found a place to call you from (as the Outfitters was closed). I got onto wifi and sent two emails before 9pm when the desk closes and both went unanswered. I finally managed to convince a bar owner to let me use his phone and I called you. Merecia was at the desk and the conversation was extremely upsetting, frustrating and disappointing. I explained the situation', 'I stayed here for a week in January 2016. The whole experience was excellent. The only reason not to give 5 stars was the food. First, the hotel itself is beautiful. Built among lush gardens, full of flowers and birds (including macaws). The rooms are spacious and tastefully decorated. My room had a lovely private patio. The bed was especially comfortable. The bathroom was also spacious and well appointed.  Second, the service of everyone was outstanding. Requests were speedily met with a smile and such courtesy. Special mention to concierge Percy who could not do enough to help meet whatever needs I had. Also to Rose in the dining room who met me with a smile each morning at breakfast and would help me with my Spanish. Kudos also to Jose at the front desk for his care about my', 'I stayed here with a group of Norwegian journalists on a Spanish language course in Antigua, and was a little bit apalled when I saw the very negative feedback from another user here.  I have quite another experience: Hotel Los Pasos was a gentle surprise, after a week long stay in another of Antiguas small hotels couple of years earlier.  I especially liked the warm hospitality and care from the host Hugo and the rest of his staff.  For sure, you can find better and more central hotels in Antigua, but I liked to retreat to the quiet and nice Los Pasos after a hard day at the spanish language school.    If you come to Antigua in the wet and humid autumn months, ask for a room on the upper level of the hotel, as the humid conditions tend to create some minor fungus problems.  ', 'Great location - Antigua is a walkable city in general but The Yellow House is ideally situated a few blocks from the Arch and the artisan market.  The property is well maintained and the rooms are clean.  Staff is helpful and everyone speaks enough english that you can get away with not speaking spanish.  The front office doubles as a hub for booking excursions and shuttles.    The bathroom on the end near the washing machine is the best one - largest in size but also the layout of the toilet / shower / sink make it easier to maneuver.    If you can, I would avoid the rooms on the first floor.  We stayed in room 5 and although it was nicely decorated, stayed cool throughout the day (there is no AC), and was large enough for 3 ladies, we could hear everything.  We are early', \"this place was lovely.  the staff is very friendly, the breakfast they serve on the rooftop is delicious! very very nice place to stay and very reasonable price! The only draw back is they turn on the fountain at 6:30 or 7:00 am. every morning so you have your very own wake up call. it's possible that only my room heard this, perhaps other rooms do not have this issue. there is no AC in the room but you do not need it, the weather in Antigua is just great. sleeping weather is perfect. nice and cool!\", 'We stayed for 3 nights. The first and third night we slept in the master suite room 201: The bedroom is amazing. The king size bed super cozy. Bathroom big. The only thing we didn´t like was that we could hear the cars on the street and the people knocking on the hotels´ door since it is always closed. The second night we slept in room 102: Very small but ok. Bathroom way too small. Only one window that faced the hall where everyone had to passed through in order to get to the kitchen or restaurant area. Not a good idea to stay in this one if you are planning to rest in the morning. Breakfast time ends at 10:30am. Can´t give any feedback in regards to the lunch or dinner. Breakfast was ok. For $1.00 more you can upgrade from continental to american breakfast (eggs and cereal).', 'Second time in Antigua, hotel do de bernal is new and very chaming.  Only 8 rooms altogether.  Request the rooms upstairs, the average rooms downstairs are too exposed to everyone.   Room 104 and 105 are good since they are the most private downstairs.  Just pay a bit extra and stay upstairs and you will get all the privacy you need.  The front desk staff is very accomodating and the worker in the kitchen.  The breakfast was just fruits and eggs however for an additional $1.00 US you will get eggs and toast.  Well worth it. Overall the hotel is quiet and very suitable for a stay in Antigua.

They loved it and when my husband and I decided to get away for the night, we stayed here.   It was charming and very nice.  We prefer a place that's a bit more lively or has a pool, but this was still a great place.\", 'The hotel was very, very comfortable.  Although it has no air conditioning, this converted, single story, 200 year old hacienda keeps fairly cool.  The garden in the middle of the hotel is so colorful with many, many different flowering plants and a central fountain.  Comfortable rattan furniture and coffee tables around the garden give you a dry place to enjoy the garden while it is raining.  At night we opened our window which is right on the street.  All rooms are \"on the street.\"  The sound of the traffic can keep you awake, or awaken you, so we asked for a rotating, floor fan (one of 3 the hotel has) and closed the window and the shutters. This step put us in total dark inside our room and almost entirely sound-proofed us from the traffic noise.  The streets are made of', 'I see the hotel got many favourable opinions and I will not be original saying that the location is really great, service wonderful and the cleanliness without reproach. I will only advice is for the jetlagged people (like is when we arrived) : the noise from the garden is terrible. American groups party loudly and the doors from inside the hotel are not soundproofed as well as the windows from the street. For us it was a nightmare wanting to sleep at 6pm. Also there is no airconditioning, so it gets stuffy, as opening a windows is really not an option. Breakast starts only (okey, okey, I know!) at 6:30 and is very basic. The fact that there is no restaurant is also a bit curious, but there are many great places around, especially the Doña Luisa Xicotencatl and \"The Pancakes!\"', \"We stayed here for three nights. The hotel kindly arranged a late-night taxi from Guatemala airport for 35USD.   The hotel is in a lovely position, only a minute walk from La Merced.  There is a wifi in rooms although it is a little slow. The roof terrace has a lovely view across the city.   We stayed in room number 11, overlooking Volcan Fuego. The room was quite small although neatly decorated and relatively comfortable. The bed was probably a little hard for my liking.   My main criticism would be the noise in the hotel. If any guests are leaving for 6:00 you'll hear them. Noise seems to travel throughout. Although this is a minor complaint and was solved with a pair of earplugs.

Also the location isn't that great it takes about 10 min to walk to the center.\", \"The hostel is clean and staff were fine.  There is no any special facilities.   I didn't like it that they are very greedy:  *No towels for Rent, just for sale *Drinking water cost money. (wich is a minimum thing you should get in a country where you can't drink tap water). It's more expensive to refill your bottle than buy a new one!!!   I would come back, but there are better places in the city for the same price.\", 'The Soleil in Antigua is well located, and it has nice spaces, and good food, highlighting the cooked to order breakfast.   The rooms are OK in general, although a bit outdated without making the vintage grading. What is not OK is the state of the carpets. They look dirty, even if they are not. I highly recommend to change to a different flooring.

Walking to town is very difficult due to unsafe sidewalks and dark at night.  The food at the hotel is not good but there are so many options in town.  The biggest issue was by far the front desk.  We booked a room for three and was told upon check in we needed another room that we could not all stay in one room.  They said they had a room for $150 a night $50 above the online rate they refused to honor the online rate.  Then upon check out they charged me $200 a night and claimed it was due to all sorts of things they just kept changing their story and refused to help.

There was a small kitchen which we didnt use but we had a delicious coffee in the morning. The owners were helpful and took us the bank to change money.

It was good both mornings. With fresh fruit, beans, tomatoes, and pancakes and then a featured hot item.  The staff was helpful when they wanted to be, that is if no one else was around they would give you attention until another local came around.  The rooms were clean with a tv and fan. But you could hear everything through the paper thin walls. Not great if you are a little sleeper. Also the bathrooms are located right in front of where they prepare breakfast in the morning so mornings can be a little awkward if you are under the weather.  We booked the Pacaya Volcano hike through them and it was a nice hike but be warned it's all levels going so if you don't want to wait for the group of old ladies to get to the top I would recommend\", \"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Sor Juana for a few days at the end of our honeymoon, and we loved it. It looks very unassuming (and borderline sketchy) from the outside, but step through the secured door into the interior courtyard, and you'll understand why it gets such great reviews. Everything is beautifully finished and outfitted.  Breakfast is included, fresh, and delicious. Plus, you eat it on the rooftop with unobstructed views of the surrounding mountainsides (mostly covered in coffee plantations) and volcanoes. Unbeatable.  The only drawbacks to Sor Juana are minor, and not enough to prevent us from staying there again. First, it's a 5-10 minute walk from the central square.

Not terrible, but certainly not worth the price\", 'The restaurant within hotel was recommended by several we encountered so we gave it a go. Quite a but more expensive that what we expected for lunch. After looking over the menu, we ordered a \"safe\" dish as we are not familiar with many of the entrees offered. We ordered the enchilada. The atmosphere was very pleasant, clean, and meals presented nicely. Unfortunately, when food arrived, we both looked at each other and asked \"what did we order?\" We had what appeared to be a plate with diced beets atop a crispy flat tostado with a small spoonful of meat, and a couple other things we did not recognize. I speak some Spanish, and read vegetables for the dish, but did not expect what we got.

My husband went there today (he has been staying in Antigua for the last two weeks) to confirm our reservation (I have the printed confirmation, but wanted to double make sure.)  Nope, they double booked the rooms so they said that they would \"accomodate\" us by giving us a lesser room for one night, and then we could move to the suite the next night.

The rooms were mostly very dark due to small windows.  Mine had big French windows, but every single person in the hotel had to pass my room to get to theirs so I had to keep the curtains shut all the time for privacy, resulting in a dark room too.

Prices of the restaurant are not the cheapest for the backpackers, but food is good enough. I was staying at female dorm room and matresses were very comfortable. There are lockers in the room and as well curtain with small light at your bed. Since restaurant and bar are open until 11PM, expect you will not be able to go to sleep until that time. I was not feeling comfortable seeing other guests visiting restaurant or playing pool, since rooms are just next door without door key. Luckely, there are lockers to keep your valuables safe. Staff is very helpful and nice.', \"Is a good place, they have an internal bar, great  food, the rooms are clean, they don't allow children (that is a plus for me). The only thing that ruined the whole experience was the end, the check out, they pretend to charge us for another room broken toilet, just because we knew the people staying there, their excuse was that the other people left and they couldn't reach them, so we had to pay for their damage, even if our room was in great shape after we used it. That was enough for me to not go back  ever to this place.\", 'My wife and I stayed for 3 nites in the suite, I must say the room was very nice with great views of the volcano. The staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs. The breakast was fresh and delish every morning. We also enjoyed a lovely 60min massage on the property for a great $$. Overall Casa Madeleine is a very charming B&B to enjoy your stay while in Antigua.', \"We stayed there for a week... and would have moved after the first day if it had been possible. There was no help with tours at all, and it was not quiet unless you don't count the trucks shifting gears as they stop at the corner. I asked about travel agencies, and was told there are none in Antigua (there must be more than twenty). Our dirty (after a few days) towels were not replaced even though I put them on the floor. They were simply hung up on the shower rod. Although the markets were full of fresh fruit, it was not to be found at Casa M. ... I could go on ... Language was not the problem. I speak Spanish. Their wifi worked well, though my husband had to reset it once.\", 'We stayed at Casa Cristina for three nights in August. Having previously stated in two other locations in Antigua,  this was quite central and only 5 minutes walk to the Parque Central. The room was very clean and although on the small side was adequate for a three night stay.  Water in the shower was hot -  I even had to add cold water once! The other reviews are correct - noise does travel a lot,  but bring ear plugs and you should be fine. We stayed in room 6 facing the street,  and only had a problem with noise once,  but it was a  Saturday night,  so not unexpected.', 'Antigua is a jewel full of interesting sights. This hotel is a little (but walkable) distance from the center and its hustle and bustle. The staff take care of you when difficulties arise. We had a couple during our visit which were readily handled to our satisfaction', 'Beautiful property.  A little far from the center of town (15 minute walk down a road, which is busy with cars and exhaust fumes), but well worth it to enjoy such a large property away with great views.  Breakfast is superb - wonderful local Guatemalan cuisine.', 'A quality hotel with much to offer; spa, restaurants, pools, grounds, lovely rooms and a terrific staff!  The only drawback is the location- it’s on the edge of where you want to be when visiting Antigua but there is shuttle service. ', 'Earth lodge was the perfect place to relax and unwind for 2 nights. The staff are friendly, the food is great and so is the quality of the yoga. My girlfriend and I stayed in the new treehouse cabin and were so impressed with the design (you feel like there is noone else around), the view and the cleanliness. I would say the dinner portion sizes were a little small (very tasty though), however, the breakfast and lunch menu portions were large. Highly recommend for the whole experience!', \"Awsome place, great food, nice atmosphere and great attention. Most def. A place I'll be coming back to soon. Was amazed by the food we got, didn't think it'll be this great. Orange juice is freshly squeezed and just simply natural, prices are reasonable. \", 'The views are great, the food is good, the accommodation is different but in a good way, specially the Tree House but I heard is always busy. I heard in weekends they have nice activities. If you want food from other restaurant there is nothing near.', 'Was difficult to find. Sign is about a foot tall and to the right of the door. The location is a straight shot to the arches and plaza. It’s further than other hotels but bc its a straight road it’s always easy to find.  We got there late and someone let us in and showed us to our room. Music was banging next door so loud but eventually shut off. Bed was broken or mattress was that worn bc you would roll to the middle bc it sagged so bad. Didn’t sleep well there. Wouldn’t stay at that one again but the staff is super nice and helpful. ', 'I was looking forward to staying here based on the reviews but found it to be quite disappointing. Upon arrival I realized my wallet had been lost or stolen during my trip and Brayan at the front desk was unhelpful and inhospitable. He was occupied with his duty to get my passport and run my credit card, not to offer help in a stressful situation. I had been traveling for 12+ hours and had not eaten and without any money had no way to eat. Brayan offered no help or sympathy in this situation, I am sure he could have found a way to help me out and I would expect that a more hospitable hotel would have found a way.   I found the room average - it was clean however it smelled of mildew and was quite dark and musty as it faced the dark courtyard on the lower level. One bed was saggy', 'One of our clients wanted to visit Antigua, and we thought that we would try this hotel which had been recommended by a friend. The price [$70] was lower than several other hotels we have stayed, but it was located only blocks from the Central Park, and had private parking - which are two things we always hope to have. The architecture and interior gardens were prime examples of how Antigua once was, and still is.  The rooms were tastefully decorated with high wooden ceilings. Ours had a fireplace and was average in size with a small bathroom - but everything worked. The bed was very comfortable. Sound from the neighbouring room seemed to transfer easily, so I am sure they heard me snoring..... Our room was situated on 4 calle, which is the main exit from Antigua; so we could', \"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights in December 2015. The hotel is lovely, the rooms very nice and staff helpful. It's in a good location, a very short walk from the Central Park in Antigua. The swimming pool was very nice, as was the bar and restaurant.   I would give it 5 stars but I have a thing about hotels who don't include breakfast as standard (which is unfortunately most hotels in Guatemala), otherwise very pleased and would definitely book this hotel again. \", \"Had dinner at restaurant with excellent Guatemalan food at reasonable price and excellent service.  Did not stay at hotel so can't rate it but would recommend restaurant for business or pleasure. The textiles sold here are also reasonable prices. If you want to experience genuine Guatemalan food be sure to try this place.\", 'Located centrally and close to Old Antigua and attractions.    Clean hostel, but small rooms and bathrooms which detracted from the overall stay.  Great communal area for eating and socializing surrounded by  lush vegetation.  Breakfast was excellent, eggs, beans , tomatoes, potatoes,pancake and fruit with lots of coffee and hot chocolate. Staff were very helpful and friendly.  ', 'Stayed in six bed dorm which was spacious. However it is right next to main road and the reception so there is a lot of noise from very early in the morning. The dorm is also used for fellow travelers to store their belongings when doing the one night volcano hike, so expect morning noise with ppl shuffling in and out! The staff make fresh breakfasts every morning and it is by far, the best hostel breakfasts I have ever received - well worth going for that alone! Can see Fuego Volcano from their rooftop whilst you have breakfast / chill with a beer! Bathrooms are great and showers have really strong pressure. Great location but not as social as other hostels in Antigua. Staff are incredibly helpful and professional. Would stay here again!', 'I made my reservation with my credit card, when I wanted to pay with it, they told me at the front desk that they didn\\'t take credit cards!!!! How isn\\'t possible that you can make a reservation and then you have to pay in cash??? When we wanted to check out, it took us over an hour to go to the ATM and back. Everything else was fine, but this \"small\" detail made our stay very unpleasant and inconvenient.', \"My room was very comfortable, the bed wonderful, but had no black out curtains in the bathroom.They need these. You didn't get the feeling of privacy. Hotel gas a lovely courtyard,very peaceful and quiet.\", 'Bigfoot is a fun hostel to stay in. The rooms are good with lockers under the beds and also reasonably priced. Cheap drinks and the food is also really delicious. You can book day trips from reception and their prices are one of the cheapest I found. Good place to stay!', 'Basic hostel, in average condition. Bathroom quite mouldy, door handles a bit dodgy, individual bed lights not working, rooms on the ground floor can hear the loud music from the front bar.  On the plus side - big individual lockers available, hot showers, curtains for each need, clean sheets, friendly staff, good location.', \"The structure & vibe is good. A great place to get some rest or meet other travelers. It's near the town square & is close to everything. Staff are nice, helpful, honest people. Affordable price. No hot water, unfortunately. The not so great thing was bed bug in the hostel while we were there, though it was treated promptly. A cat wandered in & peed on our bed too. Overall it's a decent place if you're traveling alone. \", 'A charming small hotel with a real atmosphere.  It was beautifully candlelit at night and equally attractive in the morning sunshine.  Delicious breakfast and attentive staff.  Coffee on the terrace looking at the volcano was lovely.  A pleasant 10 minute walk into the centre of Antigua.', 'Stayed here before, had a great stay. This time not so much, unknown if they were working on something but heard metal to metal noises. Was going to extend but decided not to. Don’t stay in the 100 numbered room side.

The location of the hotel was ideal as it allowed me easy access to the places I wished to visit. To put it simply, if I am in Antigua I will choose your hotel. I will definitely recommend to my friends who will be visiting Antigua.', \"After a long day of travel mishaps and frustration I arrived to the airport. My pre-arranged driver wasn't there to take me to the hotel after over an hour of waiting. I was about to hop in a cab to make the hour trip to my hotel and I called to let them know I'd be checking in much later than expected. I was told over and over by someone that I didn't have a reservation. My spanish isn't great but she seemed really confused. She put me on hold over and over and it ended up being a 30minute phone call. At one point she hung up on me and I had to call back. I think her name was Hyuang. I had been up for over 20 hours at this point so I decided to just show up and see what happens since there were so many other hotels in the same area. I arrived and they did in fact have a\", \"Finca Filadephia is a working coffee plantation that includes a resort and restaurant.. The coffee tour is fascinating, but unless they are actually harvesting the coffee late in the year, you have to use your imagination about much of the process. At any time of your, you get up close and personal with the coffee bushes, wandering the rows to find berries in various stages of ripeness. You see the tanks and patios where the beans are washed and sorted and the machine that roasts them, but unless it's harvest time, they are empty. At the end of the tour, you are served a cup of delicious espresso. And, of course, you can buy the coffee and hope it will taste as good in your own kitchen.Guides are knowledgeable and speak good English. \", 'Marvelous hotel, great environment, gorgeous rooms, best placed and beautiful decoration. But bad food and restaurant service. It goes slow, the menu is poor and despite Semana Santa is high season it was not well taken care. ', \"I stayed at Casa Cristina with a small group if colleagues for one night before heading to Lake Atitlan.  It is well-located - a side street with great breakfast places nearby as well as cute shops. The owners / managers of the hotel are very nice, too.   However - if you are a light sleeper I would recommend bringing ear plugs!  Antigua arises early in the morning, as do the tourists who are ready to adventure to surrounding areas.  Noise travels through the hotel from no matter where you are, it seems (we had a downstairs room, our traveling companions an upstairs room).  While there are signs asking people to be quiet in the hallways, it's a hard thing to control. The rooftop terrace is a sweet thing in the morning, or at sunset.\", 'The title sums it up really.  I don\\'t know how anyone can describe Casa Cristina as \"Excellent\" - maybe they have different dictionaries than me.  It\\'s not \"Excellent\", it\\'s just OK.  Antigua is generally expensive so at US$40 it is relatively cheap (even allowing for no breakfast).  The room we stayed in and the other couple we saw are a bit tatty, but it was clean with a decent shower and plenty of hot water.  The rooms are also pretty cramped and dark, and another reviewer mentioned that Cristina can be noisy, but that all applies to other hotels in Antigua no matter how much you pay.  It kind of goes with the territory.', 'My girlfriend and I stayed here and loved it.  Great prices and a great location (right next to the Merced, five blocks from the Parque Central).  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful (they helped us make phone calls and book other services).  And the rooftop terrace is beautiful with amazing views of the City.  Morning coffees starting at the Merced were amazing.  The only drawback is that noises can carry so light sleepers may be woken up when people return late or leave early.', 'It has the Antigua style and design. All areas and Rooms are clean as well bathroom, all workers are friendly, very well located. Very appropriate for tourist who need a safe, clean and nice place to sleep.', 'The main rooms and the bathrooms where extremely hot and there where no air conditioner. The main place and the pool are wonderful but the heat makes it very unpleasant.  The food and service are great ', \"     The hotel is close to the town of Antigua, so you're right in the middle of three volcanoes, plenty of pre-colonial architecture, lots of gorgeous churches, ruins and archaeological sites.  Plus, you can practice your Spanish. \", 'I attended a three day conference which was held in the hotel. The grounds are beautiful and well maintained; however, my room was a bit dark and the amenities were not accessible. The dark wooden ceiling and dreary, dark carpet created the dark atmosphere in the room. There were not enough lights to brighten the room after dark. However, the most intriguing aspect of my stay was the locked drawers and cabinets in the kitchen. I was in a condo-styled room. The kitchen had a small but full-sized refrigerator, microwave and 2-eye stove. However, all of the cabinets and drawers were locked. Each had a built-in key lock. So, I guess the pre-paid accommodations would not me to access wares to warm up leftovers or cups to drink beverages. Overall, the stay was very nice.

Like my mom said: I wouldn't come here on a honeymoon.  This hotel is beautiful with the colonial architecture and peaceful with the fountain in the courtyard and I would highly recommend.  It's centrally located and a great place to walk to everything.  Only problem is that you can hear everything and the other thing is if you're on the second floor you have to carry your stuff up the stairs.  We really didn't have much help.\", \"We stayed in one of the little tree house lodges, and it was great.  The bathroom was a separate, shared bathroom, but it was very clean and had hot water.  The staff here is very friendly and helpful, and the food in the restaurant is wonderful.  We actually did the special Friday night dinner, and it was great.  This place seems kind of remote, but there were plenty of people staying there as it's a very popular place.\", 'The hotel is a small bed and breakfast located at the end of Antigua. The massages are the best!, service is great, they only have one room for the spa so you need to make your spa reservation early.. If you want to visit the main attractions in Antigua you will need to walk a lot.', \"The room we stayed in was very nice and clean.  The breakfast was great and everything had a very welcoming vibe.  The staff were helpful, but we did have some trouble trying to move our reservation later by one day.  Initially we couldn't do it because they were full, but when we couldn't make it that night and had already left the wifi for the day they wanted us to move our rooms as we had asked before because other people wanted our rooms.  It was too late so we ended up paying for two nights and staying for one. I would definitely recommend it, but try to avoid last minute plan changes.\", 'This hostel offered a good breakfast with a nice breakfast area with hammocks and seating area. There is only shared bathrooms but plenty of options. The showers are good and hot. Good wifi and a great location. It is kept very clean and they also offer a travel service.', 'Staff is awesome, super clean rooms and surrounding. Well done decoration throughout hotel and the room. Staff is very respectful and polite. We really enjoy our stay. It has beautiful ambiance with gorgeous garden. The only issue was the noise from construction next door.', 'Stayed at the hostel for 4 nights. For the price of the dorm is ok. The rooms are clean, the only thing i would change is on the rooms (at least on mine n4), the lights are on top of the beds... If you are sleeping and someone come to the rpom and turn the wrong by mistake it would wake you up for sure.  Could be nice to change the positions of it. And the toilets are clean but small.  Anyway, good atmosphere, good food and good customer service :) ', 'My friend and I stayed here for three nights during Easter weekend. We had a 5 person dorm. The dorm was clean but small with ensuite.   The hostel is in a great location, has a nice bar and common area to meet people. The staff were helpful, you can book a shuttle to almost anywhere in Guatemala.     ', \"Comfy bed, privacy curtains, two plugs and a light for each bed, lockers in rooms, friendly staff.  Shower was cold, other guests in my dorm turned on lights and talked loudly when they got home from a night out. Not the hostel's fault but something to keep in mind if you want to avoid that crowd.  Would be much nicer with a kitchen for guests!\", 'We did the coffee tour at the Filadelfia coffee resort. The tour was very good, the guide spoke excellent English, and the coffee in the end tasted really good. I still felt that the farm was slightly commercialized, probably because there is a huge resort on the farm and plenty of tourists. As I prefer adventurous stuff myself, I would probably choose a more local farm if I was to go again. For \"normal\" people who like high-quality coffee though, the tour is great.

Equally impressive bathroom (toiletries and dressing gowns provided), although quite strange to have a coffee machine in your toilet area #whodoesthis !   Whilst impressive, the exposed contents of the mini bar with prices is a bit tacky and would perhaps be best left in a cupboard.  The coffee provided, in the toilet, also has to be paid for. Something a bit off about this in such a classy looking hotel.  Thankfully there is a complimentary coffee station a bit further on in the court yard by the hot tub. There was also a bar by reception for snacks and hot drinks.  Breakfast on the first day was a la carte and the second a buffet, both days had a good selection. I was happy to find a diary milk alternative, which has been difficult in', 'Very pleasant hotel. Good meeting facilities. Close to centre of Antigua (5-10 minutes walk).

It's only 2 blocks from Parque Central so that's great.  As far as the room goes, it was tiny.  The bathroom was so poorly laid out that my wife, son and I made a rule to never go in together.  The drain in the shower was slow to empty and the food options were very rudimentary.  The staff was helpful but didn't bend over backwards to chat or help us with suggestions for food and activities in and around Antigua.  Overall, it was a decent experience, but no frills.  The rooms and the common area were certainly clean and tidy, which was nice.  The noise level was good.    Overall, I can recommend if you're not looking for anything luxurious and have things planned out already.\", 'The Hotel Meson del Valle was comfortable and the service was very good.

I really enjoyed the nice old colonial setting of this hotel. This kind of places are not for everybody, for example my wife, but I like the old world charm of these places. Nice big windows overlooking the beautiful lush courtyard and being able to see Agua right there in front of you through the window is a beautiful experience. I enjoyed the service and courtesy of the staff. For one of the rooms i stayed at, i do wish the shower drained much quicker instead of water pooling up. Not a big deal for me. But I know folks like my wife would not tolerate such things. Second room was perfectly fine.  Watching the Christmas eve fireworks from the terrace was really nice.', 'We stayed at Hotel Casa Cristina for two nights in June 2013. Good location with lovely roof terrace.

People were arriving late and leaving early and we heard them all!', \"If you want quiet, don't stay at the weekend.  The main reason I went there was that it's supposed to be a quiet getaway, but on Saturday, the restaurant was busier than any in Antigua. I think that weekdays are less chaotic. Definitely stay in a cabin rather than the dormitory if you can.  It was freezing cold at night, when I stayed and no extra blankets to hand.  Didn't get enough sleep so left a day early.  Food was fine, not great. Staff are friendly enough.  The trails above the Lodge are good for birds and scenic views.  They turn off the wi-fi at 7pm.

What a view, this place is a great find. The shared meals ate great. All food was excellent. The tents are perfect and cheap, but the luxury cabins are incredible.   Most staff we met are volunteers - some super, others were not very good ambassadors for the place. This was the only down point, some staff were not friendly and sometimes the bathrooms were not checked/ bins emptied.   The hikes from here are great fun, but not well sign posted.   I'd highly recommend time here - weekends are super busy with day trippers so I'd suggest mid week\", 'I booked 3 nights for Christmas Eve and 2 subsequent evenings. Really glad I did. Had a wonderful Christmas dinner served family style. Also enjoyed a couple of other great meals up there. The location provided a fabulous overview of several of the pueblos near Antigua.

Nice staff, volunteers and clientele.', \"A lot of little annoyances make me want to give this closer to 2 stars but I'll concede it wasn't that bad. However, I would not return here. Apparently, the internet code received at check-in only works on one device though the front desk didn't bother to tell me that when I checked in. Regardless, the internet barely worked in my bedroom so I had to sit outside whenever I needed to do work.

At first they wanted to give me a “cleaner” room, with carpet and two beds, for just my wife and I, declined, then finally found a room with one bed and no carpet.

Having lived in Antigua many years ago it was fun to revisit old haunts.  We stayed in a family suite which had a king size bed and full size sleeper sofa.  The king size bed was comfortable, but the full size sleeper mattress just fair.  It sunk in the middle and my husband and 6 year old son rolled into each other.  We had a mini kitchen with plates, cups etc.  Everything you would need if you wanted to cook meals.

We stayed twice in the same week; a Tuesday night, and the following Monday night.  The first night was uncomfortable, but it worked out.  The rooms are CLEAN but Stuffy with no ventilation.  We could open the window, but there are no screens, and we are concerned with flying bugs, so the window was closed.  The beds are HARD and small. So are the rooms.  There were two beds, however I think they are full size not queens.  Storage for bags was limited, so one bed was used to hold suitcases, and the other for two full size adults.

The process of coffee production was explained, then we were taken to the coffee plants and shown when the coffee beans are harvested (Nov-March), and what constitutes a good bean.

It was very informative, not too much walking, but the trucks were a little high and you had to climb up in them twice.', 'The coffee farm is on the outskirts of Antigua. If you book a coffee tour from the city, it includes a jeep ride with pick up and drop off spots around the city. The upside: it’s a nice view of the city while you are driving around. The downside: it’s a bit like riding in a tourist fishbowl.  Alternatively, give your money to the locals and take a tuktuk.

I really dislike the lack of kitchen, and the room itself was just kind of ok for the money. I ended up switching to Three Monkeys, which I like much better.   Trying not to let the weird experience with passive aggressive, loud, and naked people (all seperate people) affect this review (or it would be a lot lower). I know that you can't control that.   The room itself was fine. The curtains on the beds are nice, and thank god, with the naked people in my room (if only they were a bit thicker). Bathroom was really tight and constantly soaking wet. Barely any plugs in the room to charge things, and the one there was was right next to the bathroom door so in a puddle of water. Pretty much nothing in the way of free amenities, no free breakfast, water, kitchen etc.  \", \"The beds were quite comfortable, and the room was cleaned every day. I stayed in the dorm room (5 beds) which has its own bathroom inside the room - so you don't need to get outside the room and share the bathroom with more people. Every bed has a quite large locker and they also have some (paid) lockers that you can use if you going to an overnight trip. The staff is very friendly and nice, however the manager is not. I booked the overnight trip to Acatenango through them and since I have some dietary restrictions I can't eat the food they supply, the manager offer me a free shuttle to San Pedro ($10) instead of the food.

Rooftop terrace a huge plus for viewing surrounding volcanoes (if the weather cooperates).', 'The staff are nice. The garden is pretty. The breakfast free but if you order more they charge extra- fair enough but I thought fried eggs disproportionately expensive for Guatemala-maybe they came from aristocratic hens. To get enough air you have to open the upper louvres.  Sadly for us some rather rude non-Hispanic guests camped on the sofa just outside our window smoking cigarettes, going on their wifi and noisily talking in English. The smoke came into the room with that unpleasant tobacco smell that we non-smokers find unbearable.

There are several bars/restaurants in the hotel. This hotel also holds parties in its private large rooms. We found quite surprising that a hotel as such, not only charges extra for the internet, but also is a unique device. The location of the hotel is on the outskirts of the Antigua Town, you have a 10 min walk from its premises to the center of the city, this was of no inconvenience for us.

I stayed in the dorm, which is small but cosy, and a good option for those on a bit more of a budget. There are however, tents and treehouses available at various prices depending on your preference. The transport is pretty flexible with a few chances a day to go down to or come up from Antigua, and gets cheaper the more people that go at once. There is pretty good wifi in the communal space from 7am-7pm. I slept long and well', \"Only a short distance outside Antigua, this is certainly a unique place to stay whichever 'room' you stay in.  It has a very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere and we found that especially at mealtimes (the food was good) we could  talk to both travellers and Guatemalans staying there and learn much about the country to help us plan our travels.

Exept that great hostel.', \"First of all, I'd like to say that the summary is that I enjoyed my stay at Casa Madeleine.  For what I was looking for, it got the job done.  Pros:  1) The location was great for me.  The reason is that I was attending an event at the Cesar Branas hall which was pretty much around the corner.  If you're looking to explore Antigua, it's probably not an ideal location because it's on the edge of town.  But it isn't a huge place so I don't think it's a big deal to walk around a little.  It is true that walking back at night felt a little sketchy because it was pretty deserted and quiet without a lot of lighting -- but it isn't like I got robbed so all's well that ends well I suppose. 2) The staff is really nice.  They spoke good English and they helped me do a number of things. \", \"Didn't really have any idea where to stay in Antigua, and my instinct was to go with one of the more expensive options (it was still only about $80 USD/night)   The casa is very clean and beautifully kept, with tons of flowers and adequate places to relax.

I had booked 4 nights with 2 beds, but upon arrival, I was told that there was a mix up and that we'd have to spent the last night in a room with only one bed. We told them this was unacceptable, and within a couple hours they had shuffled things around and said that we'd still  have to change rooms, but it would be to one with 2 beds.

They also offer breakfast for a small price. Tea and coffee are always available for free. They also have water coolers around the grounds which was actually very helpful because we would just fill our water bottle every morning. The location is great too, beautiful view of Volcan de Agua outside the front door, and just a couple blocks from Parque Central.', 'This hotel features a small and very pretty grassy area with trees and shrubs. I stayed on the second floor (no elevator) which has a balcony overlooking the grassy area. The rooms was quite large and clean. Because of construction on the next lot the room was quite noisy during the day, but quiet in the evening and overnight. Clearly, the construction is not a long-term issue.

The staff were friendly but at times a bit disinterested and not really sure of what was going on. The dorms themselves were pretty good, you have your own curtain and night light. Generally a tad overrated!', 'One week ago we stayed here for one night. The hostel is very nice and clean, and the staff is very kind. And the beds are quite comfortable! However, the hostel is overpriced for Guatemalan standards (Antigua is of course overpriced), it lacks a shared kitchen for guests and many things were broken. For example, the reading lights in the dorm were broken, apparently for quite some time. One of the staff members came with a extremely lazy excuse: \"Well, this is just a 10 dollar hostel\". This kind of attitude will not fix anything of course...  I just hate it when a hostel doesn\\'t offer a shared kitchen. You can\\'t call it a hostel if it doesn\\'t have a kitchen for guests.

This is a historical hotel so it you are expecting a Hilton Garden Inn - this isn't it.   If you are a night owl, having a room on facing the street is perfect for you - especially if you want to keep your windows open at night since the temps are usually perfect. If you go to be earlier, you'll want a room on the interior.  If you want a traditional experience, this is a wonderful place to stay,\", 'I visited the hotel’s restaurant for dinner with friends.

Lovely garden around which the rooms are situated.  There are many places to sit outdoors and relax.  Room was very clean and comfortable. There was a mix up with me getting the wrong bag from a van driver.  The staff could not have been more wonderful - made at least 8 calls to straighten it out. Noise was a problem.  The rooms get no air if you close window and door.  A small window opens above the door but can be noisey if you are near the desk.  Otherwise, this place was gorgeous.  Nice breakfast too.\", \"We arrived in Antigua really late at night, completely exhausted after a bus trip from Honduras and were greeted with the news that despite booking a room with two beds they didn't have one. The  guy on the desk really wasn't helpful and offered to book us in at another hotel (it was 11pm) but after sitting there refusing to leave they 'found' us a room with two beds. It was all very odd. The other issue was the rooms - they have windows (some of them open) facing the courtyard and from early in the morning, guests and a lot of staff walk the paths talking really loudly.

The rooms are beauitful and the bed is comfortable.  The only downside to this hotel is that you will want your window open for frsh air - the road is very noisy!  Admittedly, I'm a light sleeper so gauge my review based on that:  I had a hard time staying asleep due to the sounds on the road, loud people talking right outside my window at 0330 in the morning.  Otherwise, I loved this hotel and the staff.  They even found a fan for me to help block out the street noise!\", 'The hotel is beautiful. The rooms surround a large quad with a fountain. And the hotel is only a 100m from Parque Central and hence close to many restaurants. But it is a pricey option, and you can get the same comfort for a much lesser price if you are prepared to stay a little further from the centre of town. My rating of average is determined by the less than satisfactory service. The check-in staff were exceptionally slow, and showed no urgency to help us on arrival. Further, we were left waiting for 10min outside on the road while trying to get into the hotel at 10:30pm after going out to eat, as the night manager did not respond for some time to the bell.', 'Staff was helpful and friendly for the most part. The shared courtyard areas are beautiful as well as the views of the volcanos. The room was okay and the bathroom was a little less okay (especially in the room we chose I think) but once you realize that even the nice hotels in Guatemala have substandard bathrooms you get over it.

Both times we found the hotel and rooms clean with good hot water.  The room size is not large and with two backpacks there wasn't a lot of room.  There was also no fan and the rooms got very stuffy with not much air flow.  The bedding was clean and comfortable but the pillows are not great.   It can be noisy around 4am when people leave for volcano excursions and the set up of the hotel means this noise echoes around all the rooms.  There is free wifi and a computer you can use downstairs for free.  The free water filling is great and saves adding more empty water bottles to the environment so bring a reusable water bottle.  Free coffee, tea and baked goods were also available in\", 'We stayed in a room on the second of three floors, which had windows situated towards the ceiling, widish but rather short.

The WiFi had to be rebooted and was not very strong from our room.  It was better in the lobby.  The other issue we had was finding someone who spoke English in the restaurant.  All we wanted to do was request a plain hamburger bun instead of the fancy bread it came on.  This took over 30 minutes and 5 or 6 people trying to understand.  We did finally get a manager to explain and ultimately, we were not charged for dinner.  This was extremely nice and a good way to do business. Try to get a room away from the street and the restaurant if you don't like noise.\", \"We booked a night in Casa Florencia about a month ahead of time. After receiving a confirmation and despite this - every few days we got an email from the hotel staff, which was weird and annoying since we expected our reservation confirmed through booking.com to be enough. Also,  this hotel accepts cash only,  no any kind of credit cards are honored there. The reason we were staying in Antigua was because we had to attend a friend's wedding. About 24 hours before our planned arrival we called to request a possibility of a late checkout as we needed to get ready for the wedding.

After killing 3 of them during the night, they still kept invading my sleeping territory. I decided to stop the bloody battle, and I managed to get an hour of sleep on the couch in the lobby.

My single room was on the the small side - unfortunately without natural light (window to the corridor only), but with super comfy king size bed and a beautiful bathroom.   The breakfast buffet was excellent with different specialties each day. Water and coffee supplied in each corridor, unfortunately no tea.

We were in Room #8 on the 2nd of 3 floors. The double room was very small and the bathroom door made a loud noise every time it was open/shut which was highly annoying in the morning. If there are two of you with luggage it will be a very tight fit. The pillows were flat, but the beds were very comfortable, there was ample space to hang clothes and the TV had several channels.

Our room was comfortable and large but the rooms do vary a lot.  There were some problems with our stay: 1) Transfer from Guatemala city was late and the owner made no genuine apology for this. 2) There was a breakfast disaster on first morning which affected the remainder of our stay. This was the meanest breakfast in our trip through Costa Rica and Guatemala. There is a wide range of options but none is really perfect. The majority are priced at 50 Quetzales with some at 70, and we were told we could have any as they were included in our rate.

We were upgraded to a fireplace room and traveling to and from through the clusters (underground tunnel) was amazing.  The pool was very big and the kids enjoyed themselves every day after a full day's adventure around Antigua and some tours we did.  I recommend this place to anyone traveling with young kids.

We stayed in room 4 for a period of two nights and the downfall was the extreme darkness and humid room. Unfortunately we had a room on the ground floor where no outside light is able to come in. Despite the room being clean, we felt trapped in a dark cave. There was also a lot of heavy noise every morning starting at 4 am.   Would not recommend a room on the ground floor.

The staff at breakfast were quite rude and too busy to assist us, and the inclusive continental breakfast required lots of questions on our part before any bread appeared.

As it was directly under our room we got to hear it whether we liked it or not. As it happened – we did. It was fab, but not everyone might have agreed! The biggest drawback is that the restaurant was directly below and there was some noise during service. My only other point was that there was no aircon.

The accommodations are beautiful, especially if you reserve rooms on the upper floor with a view of the Volcán de Agua greeting you every morning. The rooms were quaint, clean, and comfortable, with daily maid service that replaces your free bottle of water every day.

The dorm we stayed in was fairly cramped and actually had a bit of a lighting issue down one end of the 8 bed room.

The music was not coming from any of the guests rooms so I didn't feel comfortable wondering the grounds by myself at 2 or 3 in the morning.

Security was good and we had no problems leaving our luggage with the desk when checking in and out.  The food (breakfast included) was just average, but it was nice to have breakfast on site before a day of touring around.

The bathrooms were okay - not the greatest but not dirty or stinky and they did have hot water as promised (what more can you ask for?)  I think this place is a good value.\", \"We stayed here four times over a three week period, in different rooms each time. All were very clean and well kept - the ones at the back of the hotel are a little quieter, but even the one facing the street was not at all bad. The hotel was always staffed and all staff members were very helpful, coffee and tea with a small selection of buns were available throughout the day. You can walk everywhere in Antigua from here that you need to see. You are close to Fernando's coffee shop and restaurant (we had breakfast there every day!!).

When this was pointed out to the front desk staff, they responded 'oh, that's termites' and had the maid staff come in and shake out the pillows and sheets.  They said they were full and so couldn't move us to another room, but I don't know why they couldn't have hung something from the ceiling to catch the droppings, or otherwise deal with the issue.   The amount of termite activity was so great that it could be readily seen again after only an hour. It certainly ruined which would have otherwise been a nice stay.  The bathroom and shower are well appointed and nice.  The room looks nice.  The breakfast in the courtyard is good. \", \"A lovely small hotel just off the park de central, doesn't do dinner but it is close to lots of restaurants and if your really tired you can get take aways ( I personally prefer to eat out ).

Prior arrangements by email and personal visit were not honored.  Service has been greatly lacking as well.  It took two trips to the front desk and an additional phone call to get maintenance to unlock our bathroom door with a broke lock.  I literally had to threaten to break the door in to get their attention to help me.  The food services are good, but great.  Quality of food is okay, but service is anything but quick.  For a table of three for lunch it took nearly 45 minutes to get a hamburger plate.  Unfortunately, after three poor experiences with Porta Hotel we will not be back.

In exchange, you get peace and solitude, a nice breakfast and lovely rooms overlooking a small courtyard, all at a very good rate.  Unfortunately, my experience with the hotel was marred significantly by the service.  For example, we chose to go to dinner at a restaurant recommended by the hotel, but were given inaccurate directions and, after eventually finding it on our own, discovered it was closed!  As I had explicitly asked for a restaurant nearby so we could walk (I was accompanied by a child and a senior), this proved very frustrating.

When the volcano Fuego blew, spewing ash and closing the airport, the staff immediately reassured us of rooms until our flights could be rescheduled. Highly recommended!', 'A well located small hotel just north of the city centre. Nice, friendly staff.  All the rooms face onto an open corridor, downstairs, or a nice balcony, upstairs. This means you can sit out rather than being confined to the room.  The hotel feels very secure, with the front door being locked at all times and rooms having individual lock boxes capable of accommodating money, phones, tablet computers.  Our room was very clean as was the bathroom, where we had constant hot water.   Breakfast is unexciting - juice, water melon (usually), scrambled eggs and coffee.  Good WiFi.', \"This hotel would have been nice, however it's terribly overpriced.  It's several blocks away from Parque Central and many of the tourist destinations in Antigua, and also has no restaurant on premises.  The rooms are impractically large, which is probably where the high price comes in, and while the gardens are beautiful, there's far more beautiful and interesting things to do in Antigua than relax in the hotel's garden.  But most importantly, the plumbing is spotty.  My reservation for a standard room was outfitted with a great shower, but no hot water.  After being urged not to leave immediately, I was upgraded to the suite: an even larger room, with not only a shower (that was broken) but a hot tub (which also didn't have hot water).

I did not realize the rooms did not have private bathrooms. I guess I didn't read enough of the description. This IS a hostel.  Albeit a very clean and well run one. There is a free breakfast from 7:30-9a which includes many items and the fact that you always see someone with a towel or broom cleaning. Also two hot showers. But we are not backpackers. We have 3 big suitcases which barely fit on the floor of our room so that was a disappointment as we are pretty crowded in the room even though we have two double beds.

It is not by any means cheap so I was disappointed they can't be bothered to clean up the main approach road to the hotel gates.  It is a lovely hotel with beautiful grounds, choice of places to eat, wonderful coffee tour. My problem was  that it could be anywhere in the world,  I much preferred staying in town. My major gripe and I am probably alone, is that I prefer paying as I go along, at which point the 10% service charge is obligatory and then impossible to get any change so the tip for anything ends up far more than intended.\", 'We had a nice time with our kids.

Stayed here for three nights, after my first night I woke up and noticed my left arm started to itch, dismissed it thinking it was just a small bite of some sort. After the second night, I woke up to an itching left arm and leg this time. Went through the day and at night, I went up to reception to politely ask if they could change the sheets. Good thing there wasn't hoards of people and knowing it's quite a sensitive thing to say out loud, I tried to be calm about it even if I was quite upset with what happened.

I don't think this is the norm as the person i was traveling with had a room about 1/2 the size of mine.  It has a very pretty courtyard that is a great place to relax or read.

Well located, just a short walk from the centre of Antigua.', 'My husband and I stayed 3 nights at Hotel Posada del Angel.  The first night we arrived at the hotel the shower wasn’t working properly for some reason. First of all it’s one of those showers where you have one shower head sticking out from the wall. And the water pressure and temperature are controlled by the same handle; so the more you open the water source the more pressure it gives and the hotter it becomes, except that this one wasn’t consistent for two consecutive minutes throughout the 20 minute shower that I took. I’m not sure whether it was because someone else was using the shower in the lower floors at the same time..? But the water kept changing from scalding hot to ice cold within seconds.

The breakfast was well prepared and the grounds are very attractive, with much flowers all around. The staff answered all our questions and the handiman Tino always had a smile on his face. We had a spa treatment which is very reasonable and enjoyable.   We had  the Blue room which had views of the nearby mountains, the room itself is very beautiful. It only lacked screens on the open windows as we were on the 2nd floor we kept it open all night.   Overall a very pleasant experience.', \"This was a pretty, little place and the grounds were beautiful.  However, the spa room is in need of new mattresses!  Had to stuff 5 pillows between the mattress and box spring just to get a little support.  Even then, it still sagged in the middle!  Let's just say we had   zero sleep during our 2 night stay!  It was a little far from town but we expected this and had no problem walking.  My parents were with us and are in their 60s and they chose to take a tuk tuk into town.  This is our 5th year of going to Antigua.  Normally, we love it, but have decided that we don't like fighting through the huge crowds during holy week. Hold on to your belongings whle walking around.  My parents and my brother-in-law were pick-pocketed\", \"We stayed there for 2 nights in the end of feb 2010. The place is very nice and romantic , the service is very good and welcoming and the staff speaks english. The jacuzzi is great . Room are well decorated and the bed is really comfortable. It's just that the location is not good: 10 minutes form the center.\", \"I stayed in the dorm for two nights (6beds, no bunk, but could get a bit sticky if it's full and super-hot outside) and had a great time! The hostel and bathrooms are super clean, the staff is so nice - they even remembered my name when I came back after a 3 days trip - and very helpful and knowledgable and the breakfast was the best I had in whole Guatemala. It's not a party hostel, but really has a nice vibe. I can nothing but recommend it! \", 'We stayed here for 5 nights with a break in the middle to visit lake Atitlan. The staff created a safe and clean place to return to each night. The breakfast and morning coffee was disapointing. Skip their food and go elsewhere. When we returned from Atitlan our bags were in our room ready.', 'Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, is a small hotel but clean. Breakfast is include it, a small breakfast but the service was good. The staff is really helpful and the location its good, its two blocs away from where all the restaurants and stores are. I would definitely stay again at this place.', \"This place has a fun atmosphere for visiting and dinner, but don't expect to get much sleep.  The hotel itself is 300 years old and I think the beds are original; they were severely worn out and hard.  Tip: enjoy a meal here, but stay somewhere else.\", 'In my last trip to Antigua, we wanted to drink something in the street of the arch (5th ave). We wanted a beer and some food for the children so we went to this hotel.   The service was very good, people were very friendly, they were very kind with the babies and even gave us a present for them. Very good service.   We ordered two portions of nachos that were very delicious and for the kids a portion of spagetti bolognese. Nothing special, but normal flavoured and good quality food.  The hotel is very beautiful a place where you can relax and sleep well. Very representative buildings from Antigua Guatemala and keeping the traditions from the country.    KEEP GOING DON RODRIGO!!! NICE PLACE!!!', \"I was only able to stay here for one night after a medical mission trip. It is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Antigua. The rooms are all a bit different from one another, but mine was clean and comfortable. The staff were all extremely helpful, in spite of my limited Spanish. The courtyard is a beautiful place to spend time and enjoy. Breakfast was excellent, and the view from my table of a nearby volcano was stunning. If you are looking for new and contemporary, this is not your place. But if you enjoy history, beauty, and culture, you can't go wrong at Hotel Posada de Don Rodrigo.\", \"I  was offered, by my parents, a night with my wife at the hotel. My parents bought and paid for a specific room more than one month in advance, they even changed the date of our stay so that we could get the room, they confirmed again two days before, but when we got there, they said it was not possible to get the room!! I didn't know all of the troubles my parents went through to get it, otherwise I wouldn't have accepted it. We had a nice time there, but when I was told about the room after, I got very disappointed with the hotel, and the way they didn't keep and respected their word and deal. I would avoid making any reservation in advance in this hotel, since they don't respect them even if they are also totally paid in advance.\", 'Very well located, close to the Santa Ana Arch and the central Park. It has it own parking just in front of the hotel which is very convenient. The restaurant is very good. The facilities have the old style of a Hacienda.', 'The coffee plantation was a destination as part of a shore tour arranged by our cruise ship which docked at Puerto Quetzal.  The tour of the grounds was very interesting and we learned some things we never knew about coffee.  The hour+ drive from the port is very pleasant and scenic. We were not aware that there was a hotel on the property, but the dining room served a nice lunch for the group and it looked as if there were several outdoor activities available to tourists.', 'The resort is set in beautiful grounds and I found all the staff to be very helpful and friendly, nothing was too difficult. Only had 2 problems: I was in room 2 and for the first few days at 7am workmen started banging away just outside my room on the balcony extension so the long lie went out the window and every night I would settle up my \"extras\" for the day and it would take a while to do this, bearing in mind I only had lunch, evening meal and maybe a drink in the bar to settle up, I could be at reception for 15 mins at a time. Also I\\'m glad I settled every night as there was always a item stuck on my bill that had nothing to do with me so I had to query it. But I would still recommend this hotel to anyone and wouldn\\'t hesitate to go back myself. All in all a very lovely', 'Hotel is nice looking.  But, I found the interaction with staff unenjoyable.  They sent me an email saying that I had paid already (I gave them my credit card # when reserving).   Staff at the hotel claimed that my card had not been charged and would not let me into room with charging my card.  I was baffled as to why they would send an email to me before arriving saying I had paid and then state that I had not paid upon arrival.  Ended up having to call credit card company.  Not the most enjoyable way to spend an hour on vacation.  Also found their approach to exchange rates annoying.  Quoted prices in dollars and then charge an above market exchange rate.  This was especially disappointing given the high rate associated with the room.   I recommend staying at a place like', \"The rooms are so comfortable - new beds with curtains around them for privacy and individual lights and power sockets. Adequate locker space for every bed. Despite the very comfy beds I still didn't get the best sleep as the mornings are very noisy on the ground floor - mostly the staff talking really loudly and playing Rhianna and Eminem on repeat all day! Take earplugs. The rooms on the top floor are much quieter.   There is a good bar downstairs with cheap beer, and a pool table upstairs. The kitchen services tasty food which was much cheaper than a lot of other options in Antugua - pizza night is twice a week and was really good.\", \"We stayed here for three nights. The staff were friendly but quite shy, still that is our fault for not being able to speak Spanish! The location is great, just down the road from shops, bars, tour companies etc. The free unlimited coffee was a nice bonus. Rooms were nice it was very quiet at night.. unless you have noisy neighbours in which case the walls between rooms are too thin! I'll say it again... bloody noisy Americans! That's not the hotels fault though. They have umbrellas to borrow when it rains too that was a nice touch.\", \"Hotel is close to the park and many restaurants and bars, the service was great. Room was kinda small, it lacked a safe box. They cleaned up every day which is great. I didn't had the chance to try their breakfast.\", 'Pretty much an average experience.  Rooms are in an older casa encircling a central courtyard; average size, average amenities.  Given that it is overpriced (as are many others in the area).  The main attraction of the property is it is right in the middle of a lot of local action (restaurants, bars, services) and only a couple of blocks from Parque Central.  So mucho points for location, which may make up for the comparatively high price.', 'I stayed here for 2 nights very recently in April in room number 2. Hotel might be a little pricey at 72 dollars per night, inclusive of taxes but you get an excellent continental breakfast  which is included in the hotel rate. I found the staff to be helpful, and friendly. I thought my bed was a bit too firm but I got used to it quickly. The soap in the hotel room was a disappointment. It was small, wafer thin and good for only a single use, if that. The large courtyard was a big plus with lots of plants, grass, hummingbirds, chairs to relax in, truly an oasis in a crowded city. I decided to stay in a different hotel for my third day in Antigua to save some money and that was a mistake. I got a room at Hotel Central Colonial, very near the zocalo. I paid 35 dollars cash for the', 'Only stayed here one night as we changed our travel plans. The setting of the rooms is beautiful, all surrounding a gorgeous courtyard and the room we were given was by far the biggest we had throughout our time in Guatemala. Everything within the room was nice, but it just felt like something was missing. The staff at breakfast were quite rude and too busy to assist us, and the inclusive continental breakfast required lots of questions on our part before any bread appeared. The staff seemed far happier trying to get you to order additional items that had to be paid for. We had originally asked for an early breakfast so we could do the 6am Pacaya volcano tour and were told this would cost an additional 4USD per person. Given the cost of ther hotel and the type of breakfast', \"This is a stylish choice in a very nice city. The hotel has a 24/7 surveillance and a very strong safety system (actually you don't need that in Antigua, but it feels better) The hotel interior and garden looks like a little oasis, and very close to the main square. It's only the breakfast which is the weakest link - for the 76 dollars you get only a small portion and menucard, to choose for extra dollars...\", 'This hotel [B&B Type] may not offer the history of the Casa Santo Domingo, but it is a great place to stay for a couples\\' holiday. The rooms are very comfortable and large; although the bathrooms may be on the smaller side - but comfortable. The beds are top quality, and nights are peaceful. The location is great - a 10-15 walk to either the local market or the Carmen market, and great restaurants are also within easy walking distance. This hotel is wonderfully landscaped, and there is a lovely sitting area outside where we, and with our friends from Costa Rica joining us - we were able to enjoy an evening sipping wine, and listening to music in quiet privacy. It is a small \"gite\", but everyone from reception, to service to gardeners were extremely helpful, courteous and', 'This is a great little hotel. It has a great on site restaurant with live latin music on some nights. The breakfast is basic but everything from the breads to the jams and juices are made fresh each day. They will make eggs for you but I have always been more than satisfied with the fresh fruit, juices, breads, cakes and teas. The rooms have fireplaces and the gardens are beautiful. Make sure you get a suite. They are a lot larger, more private, and are worth the extra cost. I have been visiting this wonderful property for the last seven years and one of the things I enjoy the most is seeing the same employees year after year. They are always willing to please and go overboard to make sure you have a great experience. I will be back next year.', 'Definitely get a suite to avoid small, highly trafficked rooms at the main level. Nicely decorated rooms, antique furniture, colonial ambiance, a fireplace in each room, traditinal and modern art display in the rooms and the common areas. Suites are spacious, bathrooms gorgeous, nice verandas. I like the maze of corridors and stairways, nice lush courtyard. There is a good brunch option on Sundays, the continental breakfast served is not extraordinary. Be aware that the bar closes at 10 pm. Since new business closing regulatins are enforced it is hard to get a drink somewhere after 11 pm in Antigua! The restaurant is ok, but there are better options in town.', 'This hotel has a great location (5 blocks from the mail square) and its charming. But the rooms are tiny, at least the one we stayed at. If you are going to stay here i would recommend you to ask for a room thats not on the main floor not only are they tiny (no space for a large luggage), but you can hear everything thats going on on the second floor. Aditionally, its a bit weird that you walk out of your room and there are people dinning right outside your door. Yes, its true. As you open your room door there are tables right outside, and if you are taking a shower you can hear the conversations of the people eating right outside your bathroom window (if its open, as they are noise proof ). Also, they have a pool, but you can only use it at certain hours, because aswell, there', 'The place needs to be updated.

However, the service is slow and bad, there were not a lot of people and we waited over half an hour for ice cream.', \"This is a colonial town and this hotel fit that theme. Beautiful old building, nice common spaces, nicely done rooms. (A bit dark but the colonial buildings didn't have a lot of windows by design.) We had a fireplace and little sitting area which was cute.

Great place to read and have a cocktail in the evening. The hotel bar was adorable, too.   Service was ok. They were super nice and if you asked for anything, they were more than happy to help.

The views are stunning, especially around sunset. The food is also fantastic - avocados on everything! Mostly what made it for us, though, was the people. Super helpful and friendly. United airlines lost one of our bags and the folks at earth lodge were very supportive in getting it back. The treehouse is very cozy and comfortable and provides an amazing view to wake up to. The only issue we had was hearing a lot of noise from the surrounding community and the wind, both of which made it harder to sleep. Overall though, glad we stayed there!', 'The hotel is clean and spacious and we really had a very good sleep in the hotel bed. We only managed to interact with the front desk and they were very friendly and helpful. Just that the room we got allocated to is very near the main corridor and we could hear people talking quite loudly while they were walking past. Upon our checkout, there was probably someone using some water hose to clean the garden/ space above us and we had some dirty water raining down our bathroom. That was not a huge issue since we were in the midst of checking out. Just a note for the hotel to take precautions for their other guests next time. ', \"All the other reviewers are absolutely right in how lovely, clean and comfortable this hostel is. The rooftop terrace is great for relaxation and the breakfast is very tasty.  The only gripes I have with the place are -  1. the dorm faces the street so it's very noisy in the morning with bus noise (waking up to Guate! Guate! Guate! every morning is not much fun) 2. it costs US$14/night to reserve a dorm bed (pay 75% by PayPal prior to arrival) but Q80/night for walkins. I didn't like this double pricing structure but I guess that's the price you are paying for peace of mind for reservation.\", 'Friendly, helpful staff. Good location, rooms are clean.

The gardens are lovely, breakfast each day delicious, and the staff friendly, accommodating, but never intrusive.  The room felt a little small, but the view of the volcano could not be beat.', 'The rooms are clean but small; the grounds are small and the staff is inexperienced and under-trained. For the money you should eat breakfast, lunch and dinner outside the hotel. We had 1 breakfast here and it took us an hour to get served and still they got it wrong. Considering that half our group speaks fluent Spanish, well, it just shows how bad the training is. I feel bad writing this review because the staff is really nice.', \"I'm torn about giving a 4-star review.  My stay could have been so much better, but the fact is, my room was situated right in front of a playground for kids and where the resorts parrots live.  It was SO LOUD.  It was impossible to sleep after 7am.  By this time the birds were already awake and making so much noise!  Not to mention, there were at least 3 guys working on the garden literally right in front of my window every morning by 7am.  It was really kind of ridiculous.    The hotel was a fine price, certainly not the cheapest in town, but also not the most expensive.  So for a mid-range price, I was annoyed at how loud the place was.    That being said, the staff at this hotel are great.  They were extremely helpful and very friendly.

One of my favorites...  This hotel was in a great location: walking distance to everything & VERY safe.  The rooms were beautiful: amazing tall ceilings & old antique beds (which creak like crazy).  As stated before, I'd suggest getting a room away from streets, in possible, due to noise.  Our room was missing some tiles in the bathroom & the shower was dated.  However, our friends' room was newly remodeled & the bathroom was top of the line.  The breakfast was minimal (toast, fruit, coffee).  The staff speak enough English to get you checked in/out.

The thing which disturbed me the most were the big, loud diesel trucks that drive tourists around on an area which is easily walkable for most people. the disgusting diesel smells made me not buy any coffee there - it cannot be good for the plants. On top the prices are high for Guatemalan standards.  What is fun: seeing the plants and the full process from plant to coffee (guide spoke very good Engish), unpeeling the bean yourself and trying fresh coffee.

It has a lot of character, charm and the lobby is just magnificent. The service is average. The restaurant is good and food tasteful and well prepared. I would suggest not to upgrade to a suite room as it is not worth the premium.  A few things were quite irritating. A 2.50$ charge for bottled water (small) was quite outrageous and management should realise that such a charge is both foolish and unacceptable. For that reason alone I would not choose to stay here again should the opportunity occur. Dogs barked all night for the two nights I was there. It was relentless.

It was absolutely beautiful with an amazingly beautiful and very spacious shower with a rainshower showerhead and beautiful tile. The food at the restaurant was really good, especially the breakfast that was included in our room rate, and the service was exceptional.

The staff were friendly and accommodating - they were happy to hold on to some of our bulky luggage while we were gone for the Tikal excursion and greeted us with a smile when we returned. The free breakfast is basic - fruit, coffee and toast - but good. There is free internet (which we did not discover till our final day!) and the center courtyard is', \"The hotel is amazing, the service, the rooms, amazing! Also the hotel is in a nice place, it's easy and pleasure to walk near the hotel, Antigua is very interesting! Just be carefull with the water, maybe no ice and just bottle of water. Thanks!\", \"The room was nice and not a typical holiday inn room.  It was special but didn't have that 'special' price to go with it.  I loved the shutter style doors that opened up to the garden where breakfast was served.  Admittedly the walls are thin and I could hear a fella next door clearing his throat - - - a lot!  But that's what you get when you are staying at a place that is special like this.  I would stay again.\", 'Make sure that you are absolutely sure that you want to stay at this hotel.  As soon as you make your reservation, they charge your credit card.   We tried to cancel the reservation 2 months before our stay and they kept 45% of the funds. We decided to stay at El Convento Hotel and Suites instead.', \"We stayed at the Casa Santa Rosa for two nights - room 8. The room was located off the main garden, so we didn't have ay issues with noise. The location of the hotel wasn't truly centrally - it was a few blocks from the main drags. The trade off for walking a few extra blocks though was a nice and peaceful location.  The room itself was very spacious - big bathroom, two full beds, a sitting area, TV (with cable channels, many in English - a nice find after a period of travel in small villages with no news!). They provide bottled water every day (very nice!), but there were not basic items like tissues or a shower cap in the room.   The staff at the hotel were very friendly, although they weren't as strong English-speakers as what we had experienced elsewhere at hotels in\", 'Having some previously bad hotel experiences, I was relieved to be heartily welcomed by the lady working the reception desk, Sandra--she was so friendly and accommodating! Also, the hotel had a fairly quiet atmosphere considering it is in the heart of busy Antigua. My husband and I stayed two nights, and I have to say the bed and pillows were very comfortable. We also enjoyed the simple, but fresh breakfasts in the morning. There are 3 different types of breakfasts to chose from and they are $5 U.S. dollars each, however they do not serve lunch or dinner. They do give you a 10% coupon to visit one of their affiliated restaurants (Del Arco), and the food was pretty good there. The checkout time is 1pm, but our taxi was not scheduled to come until 2:30, so Sandra allowed us to', 'Booked via pullman tour and did not get the expected internet. Beauitiful grounds. Beds hard, need to pay for additional nights of fire wood and internet.  Felt like being nickled and dimed to death. Poor gym. Nice cool pools and grounds, nice dry sauna. Wet one was not  very warm. Constant noisy events. Expensive restaraunt.  Shutle to center was always late and at inconvient times. Not impressed for the price.', 'Staff members were not interested at all to attend.  Beginning with security guards in the parking lot.  There’s not enough parking.  I passed by reception and the bell boys and not one person offered to help with luggage.', 'I stayed two days and I like to come to this hotel for the comfort of its rooms, very good food, gym and spa, as well as a safe parking for my vehicle. The people are very friendly and always helpful.', \"We booked Casa Florencia because of its location near but not too near to the center of town. It's quiet in the evenings which we liked. The garden was lovely and the staff was super friendly and willing to go above and beyond to please. Rooms were clean and perfect for my boyfriend and I. Would definitely stay again.\", \"Excellent quality and value. Casa Florencia is a well appointed little gem of a hotel. Everything is maintained immaculately and the location is very good if you don't want to be in the midst of the hubbub of Parque Central. The whole city is so walk-able that location scarcely matters. This hotel's environment emanates class, top notch service and safety.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who visits Antigua.  Anita G ~ December 2013\", 'Seldom do I like to write about a hotel. Then again well I am writing one so get on with the point is what a reading must be thinking.  First, location for those who have never visited Antigua Guatemala this small hotel is only a few blocks from Central Park. Central is key for a new traveler Banks, ATM, Coffee Shops etc all start from Central Par and Panza Verde is only a few blocks away in a very safe and quiet area.   Quiet is always key for a great nights sleep. Avoid Hotels close to the churches in Antigua as the Bells for the churches start at 5:45 ever morning. Also avoid hotels on the Chicken bus routes. Two main routes exist in Antigua for the chicken buses. One route in and one route leaving. Ask before you book a room the buses run early and late at night.   Okay back', \"I stayed at this hotel with two friends. This hotel is very nice and I liked it a lot. The only thing I was lacking there wasin room service. I arrived at the hotel late at night, tired and hungry. I really didn't feel like going out, but room service was not available there. So, that's my only critisism.  The restaurant is very nice and it has awesome life music. The hotel also has beautiful swimming pool, but you can use only at certain hours. The view from the terrace is gourgeous. they do have shuttle service to and from Guatemala City airport.\", 'With Live Music every night of our stay it was impossible to sleep before 10 PM.  The downstairs rooms were literally in the restaurant and if people were at the table 6 inches from your door, you could hear everything!  This hotel would have been OK without the Live Music.  If you like quiet there are many other hotels in Antigua.', 'This was an excellent hotel. It is located about ten minutes from the city center in Antigua. The hotel is spread out, so some walking may be necessary. The pool looked very inviting! The restaurant and bar were very good - and the food was excellent. There is an ATM in the hotel, which was very useful. There is filtered water in each room. The property is full of plants and trees, which give it a very tropical feel.', 'After surviving a long bus trip, it was a pleasure to drive into a Spanish colonial town, and find a beautiful, walled hotel in the center of everything. The rooms were decorated in the Spanish tradition, even though the hotel is fairly new. We stayed by the lap pool, in a courtyard, very private but removed from the main hotel. You went through a tunnel to get to the restaurant and large pool, which was unusual, or could go out on the street. If that is not to your liking, book in the main hotel. Good food and walkability.', \"Beware! The 300m descent to the lodge is STEEP! (& you have to go back up!) Even the paths to some of the cabins take stamina! Take walking shoes and a torch - but the view from your room is oh so worth it.  We stayed in Casa Buena Vista (2 nights) and the brand new treehouse (1 night) with a 180' view from the bed (no curtains) of the plantation, town and active volcanos. The bathroom to the treehouse has a lovely open window if you like to shower outside.   **A note to the owners: please upgrade to cotton sheets! The polyester ones were a nightmare and kept slipping off the bed and kept us too hot.**  Earth Lodge never suggests being a option; however there really are no other food or bar options close by so come prepared.

Beds are firm, rooms are safe, rooftop terrace to chill.close to La Merced, I would stay here again, free Internet, they can also arrange a safe driver for a ride to the airport.', \"We stayed at Casa Cristina for 4 nights last week. We decided to have one of the most expensive rooms on the top floor, but ended up in room #12 which is quite cramped (room 11 looked more spacious). Luckily it had some storage space and the most amazing view of the volcano to make up for it! The room itself had a comfortable double bed, bedside-tables and lamps, cable tv, a fridge,a cupboard. The bathroom was small as well, but the only problem for me was that the shower curtain was too short and the water leaked everywere. The shower has been consistently powerful and hot. The room was cleaned daily and was spotless! Staff may or may not speak English, depending on who's there (women are more reliable!) They don't provide breakfast but from 7.30 to 9.00 there's good coffee\", 'Excellent place to stay while exploring all Antigua has to offer. Right in the center of action and all paths lead to something interesting. We were there before Holy week and lots of preparations going on which we could see. Antigua is full of various treasures and definitely worth visiting. We were able to attend two services in two different churches, both of which were architecturally wonderful. Hotel was clean. roomy, quite, offering great views of the volcano, has beautiful peaceful gardens, nicely located restaurant.  Would high recommend and would return without question.', 'Lovely old hotel in the centre of Antigua. Comfortable quirky room in a picturesque courtyard. Very friendly staff and an excellent breakfast. Pleasant roof terrace with views of an erupting volcano while we were there. Lovely gardens.', \"Overall we would recommend Casa Madeleine to fellow travelers. The service was friendly and helpful.  The breakfast was delicious and the hotel is very beautiful. A couple of drawbacks are that it really isn't close to the center of town. Probably a fifteen minute walk but at night we choose to take a cab since it felt a bit secluded. We also opted for the couples massage which wasn't the greatest and felt very rushed.\", 'If you want to evade this is the rite place to be. Awsome!', \"We booked the Hotel Filadelfia after finding it displayed on a luxury hotel website. After booking online we were emailed by the hotel who confirmed our reservation. I asked at that time if we could arrange both a volcano tour and in-room massages for myself and my boyfriend.  We were told this would be no problem and confirmed the bookings.   We arrived at the hotel which is absolutely beautiful. The hotel rooms are incredibly comfortable with a stunning view over the pool and the volcano in the distance. The pool area is perfect for relaxing and with the comfortable beds and blackout shades the rooms are pefect for sleeping in!   Unfortuantely a taxi is the only way to reach Antigua and with two gates and armed security guards the hotel feels a little isolated. This isn't\", 'We recently booked the entire Finca Filadelfia hotel, for our wedding.  First of all, the hotel is absolutely beautiful, as is the surrounding scenery.  You will literally be in awe when you first arrive.  The bar, the lobby, the fountains, the gardens... all of it is amazing.  The Chef (Patrick) and the Manager (Anna Luis) and the rest of the service staff are top notch as well.  They will bend over backwards to accomodate any requests, and have a smile on their face as they do so.  However...  You should keep in mind, especially if you are looking to book a large event there.  This is a new resort (about a year and a half old), thus the facilities being so beautiful, but they have had some issues.  The facilities, though new, are not perfect.  In one of the suites, it looks as', \"We walked past this hotel twice as it is discretely hidden behind old panelled doors. It was an old school or convent with shady courtyard and charming rooms with up-dated bathrooms.  While we were searching for the hotel we met a couple who were living long term in Antigua and had researched lots of hotels in town for their parents who were visiting shortly. They told us this was the best of all the hotels they'd seen in this medium priced category. We could only agree with them. Excellent breakfast in the old refectory.  We loved it all.\", \"We stayed here for 2 nights at the start of our trip to Guatemala and Mexico.  It was fine, the room was quite big although we had two largish single beds not a double.  The room was quite dark but the shower was good.  Breakfast was nice but would have been much better if you could have a glass of juice as well as the fruit.  The staff didn't speak much English but tried to be helpful if you asked although they didn't give out any maps or information on Antigua.  The location was good.  We enjoyed the sun beds in the garden.  Although the hotel was ok and we enjoyed Antigua I don't really understand why it is rated so highly.  It wasn't our first choice at all as we wanted to stay somewhere special but most other hotels were booked up the weekend we arrived when we tried to\", 'Lovely courtyard, excellent, friendly service, very small but comfortable room, early morning street noise, terrible coffee.  Overall, a good value for a boutique type hotel.  Good wi-fi and only 1/2 block from central square.', 'This was a very nice hotel and quite close to the plaza. Beautiful grounds.The complementary breakfast was very good and there were many choices. The young man at the desk helped us find a driver to take us out to some of the villages.', \"We love our stay in this hotel. The location was perfect and the service was very good too. The breakfast was ok and the terrace where it was served was beatiful.  It has a nice bar. It's a small hotel and the services is personalized\", \"This resort was selected for us by a tour agency.  I would have preferred some place in the middle of town but still, it's an excellent and secluded property with a great view of the volcano.   Rooms were very nice although the bathrooms were on the small side.  Potable water is provided in the rooms.  Internet is not free except in the lobby.  There are two pools and areas for children to play.   We enjoyed the macaws and parrots that are brought out every morning.  Restaurant is very good, impeccable service.  We took the shuttle into town and back.  You can walk from the resort into town.\", \"We stayed for a week and really enjoyed our stay.  The staff are friend and porters helpful with recommendations and directions.  The hotel is a little outside town and the walk isn't the best due to the roads, and lack of footpaths. The hotel has a free shuttle into town on the hour but only runs if someone asks.  The pools are great and nobody hogging sunbeds.  We eat in the restaurant for breakfast and it varied in choice and standard from day to day, depending on how many people where there.   Rooms are comfortable and free internet everywhere. It works better near reception.\", 'Directions to La Soleil but it is big enough the most locals can easily find it. This large resort had lovely grounds and common areas.  Our unit was clean and well maintained.  It was a 10-15 minute walk to the central park area; we chose not to make that walk at night.  The free wi-fi in the lobby connected pretty quickly.  We would stay there again.', \"The cozy spotlessly clean rooms make the place! The staff are all so kind and always keeping the entire grounds immaculate! Oh n the beds are lovely - just like home!  Only let down is Breakfast is always more than 30min late from the nominated start time - this normally would not be a problem but I was either rushing to Spanish classes or skipping brekkie due to this.    I'd be back in a heart beat! It's such a great place to stay.  Note: there is a bit of construction going on at roof level next door.\", \"We stayed for 2 night and were very pleased with the location, the room and the service. It's located north of the main plaza, within 10 minutes walking distance to everything, yet very quiet. The rooms are cozy and clean. Breakfast is very nice at the adjacent little coffee shop. The service was great, they helped us with a lost luggage problem that required many phonecalls to the airline. Overall we had a nice experience and recommend this hotel.\", \"I stayed here in August 2013....if you are a woman traveling alone; I'd Perhaps think twice before staying here.

I would have to say I am very particular about staying in boutique hotels and the entry and gardens and overall quality of this little hotel surprised me in a good way.  Well worth the money and I would certainly recommend it.  A couple of things to watch out for.  We had a well appointed room but it was near the breakfast area and lounging couches.  We could hear every word of any guest within 20 feet of our room so the windows in the room require a level of upgrading in order to keep out the noise.  For the girls out there, the hair-dryer was very poor and I am told that is the reason why my girlfriend took sooo long to get ready each evening!!  Thank you to the staff though who were incredibly friendly and', 'Stayed two nights with my wife before moving on across the country.  This was an oasis for us that provided a spectacular setting for a romantic weekend.  Great atmosphere, service, and food.  Very quiet..sometimes felt that we were the only ones around when wandering around the property, especially on the rooftop.  Our first time in Antiqua was remembed fondly, and a big part of that is because we really enjoyed this hotel.', \"We recently stayed at Meson Panza Verde for the Semana Santa Easter Week celebration in Antigua. We loved every minute of the trip - from the ambiance/service of the hotel to the fabulous festivities going on night/day all week long. Well worth the trip! Antigua is a charming city, the Easter celebration is a sight to see. It's truly amazing. Meson Panza Verde is beautiful. From the moment you set foot in the door, you are transformed to an old colonial style setting. The courtyard is filled with plants, there are tables for the restaurant around the courtyard and down the side of the pool - a lovely setting for dinner (there's also tables in a beautiful gothic-looking dining room where breakfast is served daily too). We were in Suite 9 at the end of the pool.

The staff were not at all friendly, we were made to feel a total burden. The food was overpriced and disappointing and the loud music played by fellow guests ruined the atmosphere. I would not recommend it. The wifi turning off at 7pm was also annoying especially when we had flights to check in for.', \"We were at the Earth Lodge for the day, we did not spend the night.  But we did take a 20 minute shuttle ride (Q20 per person) from Antigua to the end of the road where you need to walk down a steep hill to the property.  My 4-year-old boys handled the walk just fine.  Regarding the shuttle, our shuttles to and from the Lodge were at least 10 minutes late.   We grabbed lunch then headed down to the play area.  My pesto avocado grilled cheese was delicious as well as their homemade guacamole.  My husbands bacon sandwich was ok.  Our kids enjoyed their fruit smoothie.  Prices were reasonable.   My kids loved the play area.  Where else are you going to find a play area with a view of Antigua valley and three volcanoes?  It's a safe play structure with an adjacent, small sand area. \", \"There is no variety in customer base and hotel like any mid-range resort in Arizona or New Mexico in the US. Why come to Antigua filled with great little hotels and stay in a place like this?. The staff knows what they should do in case of special requests but are too afraid to do so, big resort/tight management disease. Pick a boutique hotel instead. Great reviews on this site, don't go to this place unless you organize a congress/business event or travel with kids who need pool.\", \"First, I want to comment on how great several of the staff were to me and my friend who stayed in the end of June. Not all of them spoke English (which makes it tricky if you don't speak Spanish) but they really went out of their way to be friendly, hospitable, and helpful! If I were to rate them solely based on that, they would get at least 4 stars.   The place itself was somewhat dingy, cramped, rundown, and not as clean as I expected. It has some charm with the hallway decor, but the rooms on the ground and first floors were dark and gloomy; most likely because they don't have outside window access and the lighting is so artificial and poor. Stay away from these budget rooms ($33 for two twin beds) and pay a few more bucks per night for the upper level rooms that looked\", \"Great location in Antigua - a short walk to the town centro. Our stay was not perfect but the staff try very hard. We stayed two nights and on both occasions they ran out of drinking water in the morning (they provide for refilling bottles and for coffee) so we couldn't make our morning coffee. However, on the second day the staff ran up the road and came back with a full bottle. Both mornings we were awoken at 4am by loud talking - I think it was coming from the street and may have been people arriving at the hostel next door.

The website doesn't have a menu on it, but I recall that we had a shrimp and fish ceviche that was yummy, and I had a platter with longaniza (a type of sausage) that I scarfed right up.

Grounds of the hotel are very pretty, typical colonial style with central garden and wide covered walkways.  Included breakfast was basically toast with jam and butter with juice or fruit, but there were other options too if you wanted more of a hot breakfast and wanted to pay for it.  The hotel was well situated to all of Antigua and was fairly quiet, even with cars on the cobblestone streets outside.

It *is* lovely and modern and from what I can tell the only hotel of this aesthetic in Antigua.   It's still in the city proper but on the edge and thus fairly quiet. The courtyard is gorgeous in the morning and smoothies were delicious. Staff was kind and helpful.  The layout of the rooms was definitely interesting. Great for a master bedroom, challenging if you're with friends/family. The bathroom was super bright with the skylight, but that meant that if someone wanted the bathroom doors closed, you had to open up the curtains in the room that open directly next to the main walkway. To have any daylight. The skylight seems to have some sort of\", 'Great place to stay! Very clean, service was wonderful.  We had a jr. suite, it was very nice.  It is a small hotel, but has lots of character.   There is a great restaurant, very fine dining, possibly best in Antigua.  No worries about getting sick with water of vegetables here.  The staff arranged airport shuttle as well. There is a 5 star hotel in Antigua, it had a nice restaurant, but it had the feel of a resort, and seemed very crowded,  it did a better pool area if that is what you are interested in.   When we return, we will stay at Panza Verde, no question about it.', \"This was my second visit to Earth Lodge, and both were great experiences. The best parts: -It is extremely close to Antigua, but is a world away. Literally a 15-minute ride up the mountain and you find yourself on the mountainside surrounded by avocado trees, amazing gardens, and an awesome view of the volcanos and the valley below. It is especially stunning at sunrise and after dark, when the valley is filled with sparkling lights from the city. -The food is quite good overall; the vegetarian dinners are generally great. I even bought the cookbook on my first visit to recreate some of them at home. They are simple, fresh, and hearty. -I've stayed in the A-frames and the Cabana de la Tierra. The A-frames are rustic but the bed was comfortable and they did the job. I preferred\", \"I was traveling to Antigua for work and stayed at the Porta. Some of my colleagues stayed in the main hotel and some of us stayed in the Casa Cafeto (a private residence just down the road). Both the hotel and the 'apartment' (which was more of a massive house with a courtyard - I highly recommend for families or large groups staying in Antigua) were clean, beautiful and had fresh filtered water at the ready. The only issues I had was with the Wifi and our cleaners didn't show up for 2 of the days we stayed. Both the breakfast and the dinner buffets were excellent.  I would recommend this hotel.\", 'Beautiful bed & breakfast in Antigua, Guatemala.  The staff are very friendly & Helpful.  Many choices for breakfast offered.  The grounds are perfectly kept, very lovely.  About a 4 city block walk to the main center of town.  The hotel is actaully located in a quiet area.  Very reasonably priced, rooms are nicely kept ', \"I am staying at Casa Madeleine (CM) as I write this so my observations aren't biased by memory.  My experience at CM has been disappointing especially given how positive most of the reviews were.  I was waken up at 6:00 AM by a combination of light coming in through the too-thin curtains and by construction noise next door.  Even with help from the front-desk person, I was not able to get the room safe workings.  As someone who likes to come and go, I found it annoying to have to wait at the entrance for someone to open the front gate.  The other negative is that CM is a long walk from the center of Antigua.  On the positive side, the staff are friendly, the breakfeast is tasty, and my room is clean. \", 'We stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel courtyard was beautiful. They had a great terrace that we watched the volcano Feugo erupt at night. We got some great pictures. Staff were fantastic. We requested extra pillows a must and yes as per most Central American hotels the beds are a little hard. Our room was very clean  and the old style hacienda feel was great.  It is well located. The restaurant has good food but s little pricey compared to others in town. ', \"Stayed one night and paid $180 for a 1 star hotel..what a ripoff.

Attentive staff was available at all hours to help us. The only disappointment was their free breakfast which was extremely basic and consisted of bread, jam, a small glass of juice and coffee.   Also, there is a sweet shop opposite the hotel which sells typical Guatemalan sweets which were interesting to try.', 'Reading the reviews I thought this place was going to be a find.  We were frankly disappointed.  Very small, which would not be a problem, except when you are sharing a room with your entire family.

The gym, somewhat small, is quite well equipped. You should find all you need for breakfast. Nothing adventurous on the dinner menu but well presented and perfectly acceptable. Amuse bouche unexpected.  Room comfortable and roomy if not particularly well lit. No individual bedside reading lamp. Ask for a room not facing Calle 7 to avoid early morning traffic noise. Staff friendly and helpful - especially Mariana (and colleagues) on reception, who went the extra mile to help when Mrs B was unwell. Mentioned in despatches. The walk into town is not too far. OK in daylight but poorly lit at night along uneven pavement so cab or tuk tuk best. Would return.', \"We stayed here for a week. The room was clean and a decent size but very noisy. During the weekend there was music by the pool, Friday early morning there was some private event and a kids party in the afternoon, Saturday at about 6am we heard drums and a horn of some sort and everyday throughout the day you could hear the cleaning carts going up and down the hall. We exchanged this through Interval International and we're expecting a little more but overall it was fine.  One day my husband wasn't feeling good so we got our laundry done there instead of walking to town and wow was it expensive! 12 pieces (casual shirts/shorts) cost $29US and they said they gave us a 50% discount since we were staying there...almost $60 to get clothes washed (not dry cleaned or ironed) seemed a\", \"This hotel is not right downtown Antigua, but Antigua is so walk-able that you are not far from much.

With only 10 rooms the service an ambiance is beyond perfect. Around the clock coffee service, charming rooms with high end linens and beds. Bathrooms large with bathtubs and amazing hot shower.

The rooms are traditionally decorated, with brightly coloured paint, and carvings hung on the wall.... very cute! We could see the volcano from our window, and were amazed at how often the top of the volcano was covered by clouds.

I needed a place during Holy week and she was happy to recommend nearby places. On my first visit I had a room on the top floor with a view of the volcano. Very nice to wake up to!  although breakfast is not included, there are smal buns and biscuits available. Nearby are two excellent coffee shops - Don Diego's facing the Mercada church, and Fernando's on the corner of 7 Avenida Norte.

I give Casa Cristina high marks in all categories.  Friendly, helpful staff both before you arrive and while you are there, from Rosario to all the night desk help and maids.    The WiFi connection to my Room #12, was fast, robust and consistently reliable.   Room 12 on the 3rd floor -- one of the best rooms in the hotel -- was a little small, there really was nowhere to put my suitcase and there was no chair or table/desk to sit at.  The TV reception was a little too snowy -- it may need a new cable -- though there were many channels to choose from.  That said, the room was well appointed, the shower was consistently hot, and the view from Room 12 of Volcan de Agua is stunning (you can see', 'Beautiful, clean, bright.

So you either sit in your room with no air ventilation or you try to open your window then get to listen to all the people staying up late in the restaurant cafe.

To start with, I emailed them a couple times without a response ahead of time.  The place is great walking distance from pretty much everything in Antigua which was great. The décor and ambiance are great, very clean, modern looks. The rooms themselves are quite small and lack air circulation. The beds however were very comfortable!   We did have a couple small problems... Garden view rooms open up to the main area where the concierge and food service/coffee bar is. There was no air or fan in the small room, so we had to keep a window open for air circulation but then it became very noisy because our door opened up to the garden/bar area.. This caused an issue with privacy because everyone could probably hear us, and we could hear them.

Even though I give it 3 stars I would definitely return to this lodge if the chance presents itself.  Positives:  - Quirky - Inexpensive lodging - Great views - Relaxed staff  Negatives:  - Noisy - Food leaves a little to be desired (not bad, not good) - Internet was almost non-existent  Basically this lodge is good for a backpacker looking to just relax for a few days.  Notes:  There is a 300m descent into this lodge from where you will be dropped off.  If possible make sure you have a backpack.  Otherwise it's going to be a bit rough (although very doable...it's what I did).  On that same note this is at altitude.  That 300m climb is much rougher when you're not used to the altitude.  The noise is partially unavoidable\", \"In the last sixteen years of travel I have stayed at over four thousand hotels and hostels all around the world. I truly admire the location and the rooms here at earth lodge but I have to say that I found the staff to be abrupt and unfriendly. It felt like the line between staff and guest was more than blurred.... There wasn't even a line... We felt more like unwelcome guests in someone's home and honestly by the time the awkward dinner came around, we were all hoping for a taxi back home. Perhaps it's because so many backpackers stay there for a long time, I am not sure but the professionalism and friendliness just has gotten sucked out of the place over the years. This is my fourth visit in four years. Sad to say that as much as I love the location, I don't really plan on\", 'This is my second time visiting Earth Lodge, the first time some 8 years ago. I have been looking for a way to get back ever since and I happy that I was able to make it back. Before I get too deep into this I would just like to say that a hotel, a place, cannot be everything for everyone. There will always be someone complaining that \"X\" didn\\'t fit their needs but the couple next to them are ecstatic. That being said, I recall the lodge being much smaller the previous time and more tranquil. It has grown since I last arrived and that is to the hard work the team has put into this property and made it successful.

The doors open to reveal lush landscaping, a hammock, hot tub and views of the volcano.  Breakfast is great, made to order.  The staff went out of their way to accommodate our needs, even packing a lunch when we had to leave early before breakfast hours to make it to the market at Chichi.  I wanted to give a 5 star rating, but when we arrived the hotel only had 1 of our 2 rooms available.  Overall we loved it, although I would consider Casa Santo Domingo as well - similar price for a spectacular setting amidst the ruins. ', 'Great location!  Every thing within easy walking distance.  Hitel itself really leaves nothing to chance.  Our room was located around the lap pool.  The courtyard style layout was like stepping back in time to old Spain.  Food was fine.  Service was attentive and quick to serve.  Truly a nice property within a hectic city.', 'We spent two nights at the hotel on a week long trip to Guatemala.  The hotel is 1.5 blocks from the square and within walking distance to most sights in Antigua.   We had a room on the courtyard and had requested a quiet room.   This is a very old colonial building and there is not much in the way of sound proofing.  Our room was quite spacious with two bathrooms.  One had a toilet and sink and the other a sink and shower.  There is a hairdryer.  Staff at the front desk speak good English and are helpful.  The only negative is that the beds are extremely hard and not much in the way of a pillow.

Would have stayed longer but the Madeleine lacked many of the advertised amenities - no room phones, no internet, no working jacuzzi or sauna.  Besides that, our suite had no chairs or table and the tiny T.V. in our friends room did not work.  And, neither had a ceiling fan  Worst of all: when we all checked out - to stay at the vastly superior and cheaper Hotel Santo Domingo - we were shocked to find that management had forgotten to inform us that credit cards were not accepted.  A real surprise and an inconvinience that.  On the other hand, the Houseman Tino was very warm and helpful. ', 'We spent 2 nights at Porta. This hotel in particular is massive compared to the rest of the hotels in town. The staff was friendly and extremely helpful. The room was clean, spacious, with high ceilings and even had a fireplace. Our room was not facing the streets so it made it perfect and quite.   We tried the breakfast buffet but we found it pricey for what you get. I would recommend a la cart instead.   The hotel also offers free parking which is located a few blocks away from the hotel but they have a shuttle that can take you back and forth.', 'This hotel has a great location, situated just a few short blocks to the center of town. It is actually spread out over 2 buildings that are connected by an underground tunnel that is well lit and very safe. The rooms are nicely appointed, but the lighting in the bathroom was very poor.  Breakfast was excellent, with an omelet chef ready to satisfy your every request - I like the egg white omelets!! But the orange juice tasted like Orangina!

The pool was rather small, but pretty.', 'We enjoyed a dinner at this  beautiful old hotel restaurant in the middle of Antigua.  The food was good but a little pricey.

Hotel is located on a pedestrian street in the center of Antigua. The building and the courtyard is beautiful. Free wifi in the rooms. Food was also good. Rooms are decorated traditionally. The beds were not very comfortable but the all other things were great so I highly recommend this hotel.', 'The hotel is nice, but it could have been so much more.  To start with the positive: - Location is perfect in the very heart of Antigua. - Beautiful old building with lovely courtyards and rooms decorated with antiques. - Historic value - each room has a story behind it and they do a good job recounting the history.  The cons: - Our room was not ready when promised.  We had to wait for more than two hours after check-in.  The next day we saw this happen to other guests as well. - Charged for a \"view of the calle del arco.\"  We thought this would be a benefit and paid extra for it.  Instead we got a first floor room right on the street with limited views.  Furthermore, there was always a large, loud group of people right outside our window taking photos.  In the end, we paid', 'We recently returned (Feb/08) from two great weeks in Guatemala, and the first three nights were spent in The Aurora. It had been recomended by another family member, and we were not disapointed. We arrived in Guatemala City very early in the morning, and the hotel had sent a driver to bring us to Antigua. Even though it was long before checkin time, they allowed us to do so immediately. This little hotel is built around a beautiful courtyard and garden, which all of the rooms open into. The garden was a great place to sit and relax, and the enclosed nature of the courtyard gives a good sense of security. The rooms were really charming and comfortable, with beautiful old furniture.

Overall we were pleased and would recommend it, but there were a few things that could use improvement.  The location is great!  Just 2 blocks from the Plaza.  We asked for one of the rooms that did not face the street and that worked as we did not hear too much street noise.  However, the setup of the property with its central courtyard and patio with furniture outside each room does lend itself to encourage people to sit outside and chat...even late at night, and unfortunately some people do talk very loudly without much regard for others.

That problem aside, I was very impressed with the hotel. The grounds were just STUNNING. I honestly can not say I've ever seen a hotel quite like it. High ceilings with wood beams, clearly renovated but rustic interiors, lush green and well maintained grounds with waterfalls, fountains, green spaces, flowers and a spa and the room was just as amazing. My room was the Deluxe two Queen beds room. As I was traveling solo, I didn't need two beds\", 'Loved the hotel.

We booked the suite as it seemed larger that the other rooms, which was the case. But they should change the decription to deluxe room as it was not a suite as such.

The rooftop deck is worth mentioning too....a great place sip a wine or savor a cup of tea or coffee with a view of Antigua.

The gardens are beautiful and the guys painting all day add a ton of charm and whimsy.  The people at the desk are nice.   The big con is that it is LOUD LOUD LOUD!

Breakfast would be better if there were options. Ask for a room with an optional second shower that is outside. Some rooms have a loft that is nice.', 'Actually, spending New Year ’s Eve in Antigua was a great idea. Staying at Good Hotel Antigua was a semi good choice, though. Mostly, because it was the by far most expensive night of the whole Central America trip but not always rightly so. The staff was partly very friendly, partly stressed out and unable to deal with unhappy guests. The property itself was brand new and very clean. The beds were great, same as the showers. The breakfast was nice (Western style musli - but also NYC/Amsterdam price levels– in particular compared to normal prices outside the hotel). The biggest problem though was that you can hear everything. The walls are so thin, that you can listen to anybody whispering in the neighboring rooms. Hence, there is no privacy at all. And, sorry to say, but this', \"Stayed at this hotel for several nights over a two-week period in March. The owner Rosario, and her two daughters have all lived in the U.S., and all speak excellent English. They are personable, welcoming, and go out of their way to make their guests comfortable. The night security guard, Carlos, speaks a little English and is also friendly and helpful. The housekeeping staff is friendly too, but don't speak English.  The front door remains locked at all times, and you must buzz to get in, which is a good security measure.  The hotel is on a quiet street right around the corner from La Merced (the famous yellow church).  There is a coffee and bagel shop right around the corner from the hotel, across from the church.

The staff was friendly, the rooms were very clean and tastefully decorated and the terrace was a bonus. However, we had a first floor room and it was a bit noisy late at night and early in the morning. If you're a heavy sleeper it shouldn't be a problem but light sleepers might want to choose rooms on the 3rd floor to avoid the early morning traffic waking them up.  Other than that it was a lovely hotel in a great location and very convenient to everything in Antigua.\", 'This hotel is located in the heart of Antigua within easy walking distance of La Merced, Central Plaza and most of the sites of interest in Antigua.   The interior courtyards are charming and scenic and a painter is there most days painting an offering his work for sale.  The restaurant is excellent if you avoid the beef dishes (a good rule generally in Guatamala.)  The restaurant has marimba music and folkloric musical show that is very entertaining.  Also, the restaurant has the best blue corn tortillas I have ever tasted.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  Highly recommended!', 'A perfect place to stay in Antigua.  2 blocks from the central plaza, and an easy walk to everything in town.  The hotel kindly sent a driver to pick us up at the Guatemala City airport.  Behind the large wooden door fronting the street, we entered a lovely garden oasis, with plants, flowers, and haging vines surrounding a central fountain.  Our room was clean and had a large, soft king bed, with a simple but very clean bathroom.  Thick windows and shutters blocked the street noise outside our window.  However, the courtyard outside our door seemed to echo and magnify the sounds of noisy hotel guests outside.  Breakfast is included, and is yummy!  The hotel is nonetheless a restful retreat after a day of exploring the City.  I would definately stay here again. ', 'This place was recommended by a friend. Very pretty-big rooms, good breakfast. No internet as power had been out. Very nice staff. Would stay at again! ', \"I would love to be able to give this hotel 5 stars as I agree with so many of the other reviews here about it's great location, elegance, peaceful courtyard, outstanding restaurant and generally excellent service.  However, the devil is in the details -- and in the follow up after leaving. To the latter point: I find it unacceptable under any circumstances, especially when a hotel is as well recognized as the Dona Leonar, when the management refuses to respond to inquiries after the stay about expenses charged without explanation. In my case, they added a charge to my shuttle to the airport without telling me ahead of time or at the time I gave permission to add it to my bill. They had responded very quickly before I arrived to various questions I had via email, but they have\", \"I really enjoyed staying at this hotel.  The facilities were extremely nice.  Our room was clean with two comfortable queen beds.  The breakfast was fantastic especially when they had the buffet on the weekends.  The only issue I had was that the A/C didn't get as cold as I would have liked it at night.  But I would stay there again in a heartbeat.\", \"Unluckily we had constant rain for the days we arrived in Antigua. The rain leaked under the door and through the windows after the non stop rain. The not so private terrace was just an extension of the communal area and we were the furthest away from the bathrooms. If it wasn't raining the room would of be lovely with a lovely view of the volcano. We had a free volcano tour included with our booking which was a good bonus. However it was raining too. The front service desk was amazing and so helpful and with booking tours and travel. Breakfast included was lovely too. Would recommend just booking a standard room rather than the room with the view as wasn't worth it but lovely little place \", \"We were supposed to stay here on Saturday, November 15 but had to leave Guatemala last minute due to a death of someone that we were traveling with. I called the hotel on Friday when I got home to cancel our stay and was told that I was within their cancellation policy. I talked to eBookers who I originally booked with and they said they would refund it if the hotel approved it. The hotel did NOT approve it. I emailed the hotel thinking they truly couldn't be that heartless and I got an email back from Emilio reminding me of their cancellation policy. It was a death, not something I could plan around your cancellation policy. Every other hotel and airline reimbursed us to help us during our tragic time and this hotel is only concerned about getting their money. It is really sad\", \"Located in an excellent location just a few blocks' walk to many attractions, I found the Hotel de Cathedral to be much nicer than I expected, with a simply beautiful courtyard, and comfortable, quiet, well appointed rooms in local rustic decor.  It was hard to rate this, as it's probably a five star by local standards, but I subtracted a star given the rooms are a bit smaller and darker than average, and the included breakfast, though a nice touch, was very plain. Overall I found nice hotels in Antigua to be far more expensive than I expected; paid well in excess of $100 plus exorbitant taxes. Overall, well worth a stay, and I'd definitely return.\", 'We stayed here for 3 nights, really loved this place great breakfast, nice and clean rooms, perfect location, and very profesional and friendly staff, family friendly!

I highly recommend the breakfast, a real bargain for $5, plenty of fruit and food.

Not per room, per device! Otherwise the hotel is lovely. There are two pools, gorgeous gardens, and the rooms are very clean. The linens are top-quality and the beds are very comfortable. The restaurant was a bit pricey but expected at this level of hotel. Very safe location with safe parking and good security. Front desk ladies were very helpful. Gentleman at the tourist information was great. \", \"This hotel is located on the outskirts of Antigua...a short walk to the main town square. It has many well appointed rooms, a pool, a great spa, and provides an incredible breakfast. Cappuccinos and wine by the glass are great here. Wifi is strong and reasonably priced. Great views of the surrounding volcanoes. We had some trouble with staff being able to speak English or carry through with some requests due to lack of understanding so I would suggest they hire someone to cater to international groups to ease the problems. I would also suggest dedicated space for groups to use free of charge for short meetings or gatherings. Overall, a great place at a good price. I'll be bringing many groups back here.\", 'Clean hotel, comfortable beds, good breakfast buffet. Staff always pleasant. However, no coffee maker or fridge in the room unless you pay $10 a day.

The grounds are well kept and beautiful.', 'The rooms are very clean and small but nicely styled.  However it is about 4 blocks too far away from the center and the breakfast is awful and mean - only edible because it is free.  Owners can also be a little commanding, which is their choice when it is with their staff but strange when they act this way to their clients.', 'Hotel Casa Cristina in Antigua is a good choice for the budget-minded traveller.  This place is not fancy, and the rooms are on the small side.  But it is very clean, has a lovely little roof-top terrace, and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful.  One of the nicest things about it is the location.  Just behind the Merced Church, Casa Cristina is a 5-minute walk to Parque Central, but much quieter than the hotels on the Parque. We would definitely stay here again.', \"I picked this hotel after the reviews on TA - in the end it was a sweet place but nothing really to rave about.  PROS - very clean and safe, plenty of fresh white towels, quiet roof terrace over looking the rooftops up to the volcanoes and the Merced church, really lovely staff, free internet on computer in reception, great location  CONS - there wasn't anything bad about this hotel... it just wasn't anything super special (aside from the rooftop). We were in the cheap rooms downstairs which either had no windows, or a window facing into a dark corridor. At $27 a night they were a good deal for a couple wanting a clean and safe place to crash at night.  If you're a backpacker wanted to meet people however, this is not the place for you. If you're a couple, it's a nice stop.\", 'This is a very pretty hotel and we would have been delighted with it had we not had the two smallest rooms which were airless and had very dated bathrooms Service by the ever present waiter Simon was fantastic and breakfasts delicious.', 'Hotel Posada del Don Rodrigo is suited in the center of the city but the whole city is in walking distance so I would not put to much  emphasize  on the location.

Wi-Fi works wonderfully, restaurant is in a beautiful spot.I would definitely choose this hotel again', 'This hotel was booked for me, as the original one was sold out. The courtyards surrounded by bouganvillias, benches, Marimba and fountains everywhere were a beautiful surprise.  The terrace has great food/drinks with an amazing view of the Volcan de Agua.  The doors are huge with Skeleton keys, adding even more character to the place.  Step outside and you are in the middle of all the action.  If you like walk around and adventure, this is the location for you.', 'we were invited to a wedding at Antigua, so we decided to stay for the night. honestly, I asked for availability at other hotels and they were all booked. The hotel is beautiful and the location is perfect. I did feel that the rooms are quite simple for the price.  I always carry my toiletteries everywhere I go but being only one night, I thought of packing light and use what hotels usually leave for you at the bathroom, which was a mistake because there was nothing! not even toothpaste . Although I must say that the staff at the front desk was kind enough to send someone to buy it for use :) staff was very nice! Breakfast was delicious and the restaurant area is beautiful. ', 'The highlight of this hotel is the landscaping of the beautiful interior courtyards.  They provided a wonderful place to sit and relax, knitting, reading, or chatting with friends.  Somehow the hard beds and not too comfortable chairs faded into insignificance because of the beauty of the setting and the kindness of the staff.  The food is good, if a little bland (true, for me, of all Guatemala).  The location of the hotel is perfect, a short walk to everything.', 'Hotel was very nice and the staff was very helpful.

It is a high end place, and it is expensive, especially for Guatemala.  The rooms are small but nicely furnished and clean. The public areas are extremely nice. The hotel staff will assist you with anything you need (for a fee, of course). The restaurant is very pretty, but the food is mediocre. The internet was slow and unreliable.', \"Loved my stay here.  Very relaxed place.  Family-style dinner on Saturday night was DELICIOUS.  Great view all around.  We stayed in the dorm, which was fine.  I'd like to try out the tree house at some point.  Bit of an adventure to get there since the road is closed due to construction, so you need to walk quite a bit.  It's enough of a hike that I'd recommend wearing tennis shoes getting there; my flats gave me blisters walking down the hill.  The walk is beautiful and tranquil, though, and I really enjoyed it. Price is right!  Q50 per night for the dorm (about $6.50), and the meal was Q65 ($8).   And did I mention the great view? When we were there, we didn't do any of their hiking--though I know it's available.  We just sat and relaxed and enjoyed the view.\", 'It depends on the kind of traveller you are, as to how or whether this place will appeal to you. I am not much of an outdoors/hiker/eco tourist type (which is probably who this place will appeal more to), but even so, I felt the owners were very genuine about their eco credentials, whilst naturally trying to appeal to all types of people.  I stayed in one of the A-frame cabins, which was basically 1.5 beds, with the shower/toilet being communal and outdoors (natural compost toilet).', 'Conviently located two blocks from the central square, this affordable hotel was a pleasure to stay at. The well maintained central garden is surrounded by large very clean rooms. The tasty breakfast is served outside  in this delightful flowered garden. The rooms were well equipped with all the necessities. Staff were friendly and spoke some English. We will definitely stay at the Aurora Hotel on our next visit to Guatemala.

We stayed for four nights, in two of the master suites (Dona Leonor and Don Pedro), and we loved our rooms.  However, the service was patchy at best, and there is much that could be done to improve the client experience.  What was missing - - a do not disturb sign - a mini bar - some way of making coffee or tea in the room - a bar that was open past nine pm if no mini bar in the room - some assistance in explaining the hotel amenities (there was nothing in the room, and we found the pool by accident) - proper wifi - it was very sporadic and weak, and for $300 they could easily by a router booster  and what was\", \"If you wish to be right in the middle of town and walk to all the best resturants and shops...STAY HERE!

The property itself is small but very beautiful (Approximately 12 rooms).  The owner and staff are very nice and the rooms are very well decorated.  It is located only 1/2 a block from the main plaza in Antigua.  We've had some issues with the restaurant but I feel those things are being worked out.\", \"The rooms here are good, although the beds are a bit small on some of them. There is a good travel desk and they helped organise lots of our trip for quite reasonable prices. The hostel is quite basic and doesn't offer any more than that (but you don't really need it to as you are in the centre of Antigua). The breakfast was however really really good, and we came back on our return to Antigua just for that! \", \"We had a really nice stay for just 1 night. On the terrace you meet interesting people from all over the world. Very unique was seeing the eruption of the vulcano from the roof terrace! Breakfast & sleep quality was really good. Too bad we couldn't stay longer!\", \"It's not the prettiest from the street but once you go in and up, there is a lovely terrace to have breakfast, do your spanish homework and socialise. Rooms were small but clean. Breakfast was enjoyable.Communal kitchen was useable but only if you had it to yourself. I doubt you'd be able to cook alongside another. Bathrooms were always clean, however when we stayed there it was a bit unfortunate that something went wrong and weren't able to use the toilets or showers for more than 8hours (2-10pm). I understand that it's unforeseeable that something like this can happen but what are guests meant to do in the meantime? Even a small discount in a night's stay would've been appreciated to honour guests' patience and understanding.\", 'Just returned from two amazing weeks in Guatemala!  We spent two nights at the Hotel la Catedral, though we actually thought we had reservations for three nights.  So we spent the last night at Porta Hotel Antigua, which we highly recommend.  The first night at Hotel la Catedral, we had a nice but small room with a king size bed but asked to be moved because it was located on the street side and very noisy.  The second night we moved to room # 8, which was much larger and located off the street so not as noisy.  The worst part of our stay at this hotel was that my camera was STOLEN from our room!  Losing the camera was bad enough but it had all of our pictures from our two week vacation, which can not be replaced.  Of course when we reported this to the hotel, they said nothing', \"After my long-time favorite hotel (The Cloister) closed a few years ago, I was interested in finding something like it: small, fresh breakfast, not far from the park, well-maintained and feeling colonial.

The bathroom on the small side too, but nicely appointed. The wifi was so-so, and breakfast was the same. The staff was nice and helpful.   This was not - by any stretch of the imagination - a bad hotel stay. Just considering the price and what you get for it, it wasn't worth it to me.

The rooms are nice if a little dark, staff are nice and location is great.  The major negative for me is how the price is disclosed on the various booking sites. Price is quoted less taxes and charges which in total come to 28%. I feel this is dishonest . We did not experience this in other hotels. If this was sorted I would be happier with the hotel.', 'Great spot for a romantic getaway right in the heart of Antigua! Close to the center in the opposite direction of the arch so it is very quite at night but easy to get to everything in town. Walk to nightclubs, restaurants, the large market etc. stayed in a room with a hot tub, desperate shower and a long sized bed. Room was a bit small but very clean and well kept. Staff were informative and polite. Would stay here again in the future but next time would ask for an upstairs room or one not next to the laundry as it was a little loud in the morning.

This is not bad, of course, but if you're looking for a more local and historical accomodation, you have to choose another property.

But this one has plenty of parking so you will not have to worry about your car.  Don't get me wrong, the hotel is not far away from downtown, and they offer a free shuttle from the hotel to central park a couple of times a day.

Yes, the rooms are nice and yes the grounds are pretty, but there are so many places in Antigua that provide human warmth and greater proximity to the center - that this place should be boycotted until it learns to treat clients like they are welcome and at home.

You won't regret it, really ^^\", \"The grounds and rooms are fine as is the dining. But unlike every other hotel on our 5 country trip this one charges for Wi-Fi, has no bottled water in the room even though the sign on the bathroom mirror says not to drink the water from the tap. There is a ceramic filter jar in the room to filter your own water but who knows when it was cleaned. They don't have a wine list and the waiters can only tell you approximately what a bottle will cost. Then comes the surprise that the estimate was low compared to the actual cost. Lots of room for improvement.\", 'My family stayed at this nice hotel. It is a small resort like set up. The rooms feel earthy and have character. I believe this used to be a different hotel resort back a few decades ago.The room we stayed at was clean and bright and comfortable. There were two queen sized beds, a fireplace, tv, and an acceptable bathroom.I would not say this hotel has a modern feel but it does has character and charm. There is a lovely pool area where my daughter had a blast. It was very lovely for me to walk the hotel grounds.

To its credit- it is clean and well-maintained. Otherwise it is average at best. Compared to similarly priced locations, however, it is rather far from the park and the rooms are smaller than average. The two huge problems though are the noise (and I'm a sound sleeper) and the fact that it is cash only.   Even $10 a night hostels take credit cards. This is a problem for 2 reasons: first, cash is difficult for reimbursement purposes, and secondly, tourists should not be carrying around large amounts of cash in Guatemala.  The noise was the worst I have experienced in Antigua. At night there was a very loud bar and in the morning the\", 'Very cute little hotel with a great location in Antigua. We checked into our rooms and were kindly accomomated with any special requests. We booked three rooms and were all very pleased. The beds were a little hard but everything was clean and neat.

It is close walking distance to all the sights and a very cool little outdoor bar called \"Jardin Bavaria\".  Some people complain about the noise but I thought it added to the ambiance of the beautiful city. Besides, it was church bells and roosters which can be charming. There was a rooftop deck looking out over Antigua and onto the volcano\\'s in the distance. They supply coffee and pastries in the morning free', 'Location and price are definitely a plus. Hot(ter) water would make the shower more comfortable, but who needs to shower everyday!? ;-))', \"Stayed here for five nights as a solo traveller. It's good value but Antigua was cold in the eventings and the hotel rooms were v cold both day and night due to internal windows.

Hammocks all over the place, it's a very beautiful hotel indeed.   We stayed in two rooms at the Meson Panza Verde, just because we want to experience the different rooms available. The first room is on the ground floor and we had our own garden patio, the second room was upstairs - the staff moved us to this room while we were out climbing a volcano, Volcan Pacaya and they managed to not lose a single item while moving us to the new room.

They believe they are a small, luxury, boutique hotel offering far better amenities and services than other hotels and hostels in the city.   From my experience, I would strongly disagree.   I wish my experience was better because I understand the trickle down affects that these reviews have on the business side of these hotels and their employees, more importantly, since people do not get paid well in Antigua.  But, so many things went wrong combined with the rude and annoyed response from management that I felt people should know what they are getting into by staying at Meson Panza Verde.

Our second night, we opted for \"deluxe camping\", instesd of the dorms, as I hadnt been sleeping and didnt want to be woken up by people going in/out. However, I thought to call it deluxe is a mighty joke. It was 60Q per person, purely for the luxury of staying in earth lodge.

For what they charge, you should at least get a cup of coffee in the morning.  Not my kind of place, never again.', 'Extremely nice and smiley staff . No problem in changing room because mine was too dark . Close to center, and quiet with a small terrace.  Unfortunately, all the rooms are very dark, with inadequate lighting, the bathroom has a weird design with an useful \"spa bathtub\"  and an unpractical access to the sink. i think  this hotel is mostly booked by groups, which means it is noisy at night ( altough they toned it down when I asked) . They also occupy the small terrace.  The breakfast is $5 more ( did not take it so do not know the quality )  Best room is number 6 with a private outside lounge, but even so this is not worth the $100+ room when there are so many other choices  in Antigua', \"Stayed three nights here and had a good experience.  There is nothing fancy about this hotel, but it is clean, quiet (an issue in Antigua) and well located.  Excellent little coffee shop/wine bar next door which makes great baguette sandwiches.

Nothing to blow your socks off but if you want a dependable place to stay, this hotel will do just fine.

Breakfast each morning was fantastic.

It is centrally located just a few short blocks from Parque Central and just on a quiet side street just around the corner from La Merced and near some great coffee shops, restaurants, and street food.  The rooms are small and the walls are thin but they are clean and there is cable TV.  The staff is very friendly.  La duena de la casa pre-arranged a ride to pick us up from the airport in Guatemala City at 5am on Christmas morning, which we greatly appreciated.    The front door remains locked at all times, which might seem inconvenient, but there is always a friendly clerk on duty and it really makes the hotel feel much safer than some place where anybody can just stroll in.

Wear good walking shoes...cobblestone streets!  Now the negatives. The rooms are so so.  Beds are hard, mold smell, and most bathrooms pretty terrible.,,,water doesn't drain, not very clean..etc.  They advertise wireless, but you have to go to business center to use it, which sometimes doesn't work.

They had maps and showed us where the best jewelry stores were in town; my friend was looking for some pieces for her jewelry line. It has the feel of Antigua from the huge wooden front doors, to the many courtyards with flowers. The key to open the door was a true old fashioned long, metal key that you would expect to see in an old castle. The room we had was very large with 4 double beds in it. The bathrooms are very small, but the shower was large. I was not able to get any hot water for my shower however. The beds were very firm like every hotel we stayed at in Guatemala.

Quite an adventurous road to get there on your own, but they have an excellent driver that will bring you to the lodge from Antigua for a reasonable price.  The first thing everybody will notice is the view. It's beautifully located high on the slope of a mountain overlooking Antigua between its famed volcanos.  The second best thing of the lodge are the beautiful cabins. Throughout the grounds of the lodge there are about 10 (?) cabins, each one designed and built in a unique and always brilliant way. There is an actual tree house, the size of exactly one queen sized bed, actually built in a tree with an extraordinary view from that bed. And an other cabin with two floors, also built around an other tree with\", 'Nice colonial atmosphere.  The staff is helpful and efficient.  It was cold so they came to light a fire in our room at night (the rooms all have fireplaces).  The bed was very comfortable.

There is a second, lovely pool on the other side of the hotel (there is an underground passage that connects two blocks of buildings).  The location of the hotel is excellent, just off Fifth and near many attractions in Antigua.    From the top terrace of the hotel you can see the volcanoes very well (volcan Agua and volcan Fuego -- which erupts throughout the day).    Would highly recommend this place.', \"An undeniably beautiful hotel and setting, the choice to stay here depends somewhat on what you're after. The comfort and rustic luxury was definitely appreciated on my first night, after a long day of travel from the U.S. However, after a time, I found the overall atmosphere rather stuffy, pretentious, not the level of basic down to earth friendliness I've come to appreciate in Latin America. This seemed more geared toward large groups, and business people; not quite what we were after. We were a little disappointed that breakfast was not included in the high price, and we had an issue with a run-on toilet that took multiple calls to the front desk to get resolved. Wi-Fi was OK but could not receive email on our iPhones etc (iCloud accounts) and had to use public internet\", \"My father and I travelled to Antigua for a friend's wedding and we found Palacio de Dona Leonor to be a lovely boutique hotel smack in the heart of Antigua.

The formal garden in the interior courtyard is alone almost worth a visit. The entire staff - reception, chamber maids, bartenders, waiters & waitresses, maintenance & groundskeepers  - were always very helpful, polite & friendly.

You'll end up in your room or on a chair in the hall.  Don't get me wrong, the place is nice, it's just a bit confined and lacks the verdant spaciousness that a few extra bucks may get you.   Gracious hosts and good value.  All in all a good choice.\", 'We recently visited Hotel la Caterdral for 4 nights.  There are 8 rooms at this hotel so service is personal and was excellent. Larger windows and fans as previously mentioned would have made our stay slightly more enjoyable but there were a lot of pluses here.    They served a wonderful breakfast every morning which was included in the room price. There were about 10 different choices in the breakfast selection. The location was excellent and the city was so close.  The manager arranged tours for us and that was a big help.  He also arranged for our transportation to and from the airport in Guatemala City.  His English was excellent which helped us some.  I would stay here again.  Location and service was 5 star.', \"highly recommend this property- no hesitation at all!  first the negatives, which are not many and quite inconsequential...  room was a bit stuffy- no window- a ceiling fan would have been quite a welcome addition vs. the noisy floor tower fan.  uh- that's about it!  positives... so many! very nice staff and so helpful. our flight was cancelled coming down and even though we had a non-refundable rate, the hotel invited us to stay another night on them.  very classy and so welcomed after a rough start to our vacation.  room was comfortable and lent to incredible sleeping!  can't remember the last time I slept 'in', but the comfy bed, surprisingly quiet room (middle of town!) and pleasant surroundings made relaxing a cinch.  courtyard is quaint and adorable-  easy to relax just\", 'Good Hotel Antigua is a relatively new small hotel located in a very quiet and conveniente place in Antigua.

The location is perfect though a short walk from the city center.  The hotel gives money to children in need and this was a huge plus for us too! The lack of air conditioning was absolutely no problem for us.  There are just a few minor remarks: 1) They should make it possible to eat inside or replace the plants that attract the bees - as it is now, you eat outside (since the dinning area is open). The reason is that there are so many bees that we could not enjoy our delicious food at times (especially in the morning).  2) We couldn't borrow iPads though they wrote it as a service possibility. \", \"This is a relatively new site, with wonderful bathroom fixtures and amenities.  Staff is very friendly and attentive.  There is a common area where they serve a choice of complete and delicious breakfasts (additional charge).  Cautions/complaints:  the hotel is located on the edge of the tourist section of town, on a very secluded street; I wouldn't recommend walking there after dark (maybe take a tuc-tuc?).  Rooms do not have good acoustics, you hear anyone in the passageway all night long.\", 'I booked this room as a three star and it was about that.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was small but nice and clean.  The wifi did not work on the room and that was a little annoying.  They had coffee, tea and water on all day and that was a nice touch.  The staff were very nice and helpful.  The location was good and far enough away from the square to be peaceful and quiet.  The room was hot and a fan would have been helpful.  The shower was hot and powerful. The matrasses was not comfortable.

Unfortunately, it was my least favorite of all of the  5 hotels we stayed in during our trip, and it was mainly due to rude service that we received during our stay. We are a young couple in our mid twenties. I am American and my husband is Costa Rican, we live in Costa Rica. When our driver dropped us off at the gate, in the rain, we waited about 10 minutes before someone emerged to open the gate for us. No, hi, how are you, welcome to Hotel Meson del Valle.. nothing! The girl walked to the desk, looked at a computer and asked our names, and then told us the room isn't ready, and went back to doing something on the computer. We knew\", 'beautiful court yard, the room was a little small. Fantastic location, walking distance to everything, very close to the arch. Staff was very friendly. Breakfast is included and it was perfect, try to go early because it gets pretty busy from 8-10, service is a little slow during that time, internet was good', 'We stayed at Don Rodrigo last May and loved it.  The service was very friendly and efficient and they were quick to help us arrange massages, local tours and provide restaurant recommendations.  Our room was comfortable and beautiful in a slightly rustic way.  The interior courtyard was a welcome sight every time we passed through it.  Don Rodrigo is also very close to some of the best shops and sights in town; we found it to be a very convenient launching point.  Overall, we would definitely stay here again and consider this a 4.5 star hotel.', 'Very nice hotel, spacious room, very clean. The courtyards are beautiful and the restaurant was very good.  The level of service was evident during a late-night request for an extra bed for a team member who feeling unwell.  The staff brought it in and set it up within 15 minutes, and even brought extra towels with the linens.', 'Once you enter the hotel gate on St Lucia, you leave the frantic hub bub of old Antigua. After a relaxing dip in the pool and a reasonably priced massage in the Thai Garden you are conveniently near a dozen cool restaurants. Food at the hotel is main stream and the price is right. Rooms are stuffy in the day but cool by bed time.', 'Soliel La Antigua is a very beautiful place that keeps there traditions and upholds nature in various part of their building. Rooms are nice and cozy. However, the downfall was the tap water that had a brown color as if it was dirty. This hotel should keep in mind that we use the water for different uses. The other downfall was that there was no free wifi. All hotels that I have visited have free wifi as a courtesy of staying with them. Apart from these downfalls the hotel was ok, breakfast and dinner was delicious and appearance is amazing.

The rooms have an antiquated look with a built in fireplace and fans. The weather it's so good that there is no need for air conditioning with the temperature them warm during day and slightly chilly during the night.  A centrally located swimming pool is an ideal place for relaxing while the Sun is out. The staff is nice and some are bilingual such that English speaking people will not have a problem.  An eclectic mix of juicy Central American fruits and dishes from the Region along with Continental fare was on offer for breakfast.\", 'Business and family oriented facility.

It is a fabulous choice in Antigua, especially if you want privacy and quiet.  It is a bit pricey by Antigua standards (especially if you bring kids, as they charge quite a bit extra).  However,  it is probably worth the price if you are looking for luxury without a \"touristy\" feel that you\\'ll get at Casa Santo Domingo, which is about the same price.    We stayed here for three nights in the Mary Sue Suite with our two young children in an absolutely beautiful room with a queen bed,  fold-out couch for the kids, fire place, very small private \"patio\" (not really usable, nice nonetheless), and gorgeous bathroom with hot tub.  Amenities were excellent.   The room was really amazing --', \"My husband & I stayed at the Panza Verde for three nights in May.  The hotel was absolutely beautiful! We were in Suite 6, which had a bidet and a mosaic tiled bathtub that was big enough to swim in! We ate at the restaurant for their Sunday brunch and it was wonderful. We also came in late one evening and ordered dessert from the restaurant and they delivered it to our room which was very nice. The complimentary breakfast consisted of fresh fruit, homemade bread for toast, muffins, cheese, a breakfast tamale, cereal, and coffee and fresh squeezed juice.   The only negative part of our stay at the Panza Verde is that there is no air conditioning or fan in the room and there are no screens on the windows.

After staying at El Hostal, the Earth Lodge gave us a much needed rest from the frantic city that is Antigua.  The communal supper & the ham soup & the lentils soup I ate during my one night stay at the lodge were all very good and felt much more satisfying than the beans and salsa meals typical of Guatemala.  We wish there was yoga classes more than 2 days per week. The view from the lodge is fantastic, so is the hike around.  The beds are a bit uncomfortable and feel very damp to the touch. I would've appreciated a little more bedsheets but that's just me.\", \"Positives: The Tree House and it's private bathroom were a wonderful space. We loved just relaxing on our private deck and the quiet. The view was spectacular. It was clean.   Negatives: You really have to eat your meals there unless you want to go all the way back to Antigua which is a bit counter intuitive given that you wouldn't want to leave the tree house. Dinners are on a scheduled time and you have to sit and eat with all other guests. Great if you're traveling solo or wanting to meet other young people, but not so much if you want privacy/alone space.  The staff were a bit too high strung (again, fine if you want to meet other young people, but not so much if you'd prefer a quiet and relaxing time without having to make small talk). Dinner was served 30 mins late. The\", 'During our recent stay at Palacio de Dona Leonor we were charmed by the interior courtyard of the hotel and comfortable rooms.  We stayed in Dona Lucia’s bedchamber which had the large balcony facing the volcano and you could see a slice of central park as well.  Once you closed the glass doors to the balcony all the street noise was shielded and when you shut the wooden doors you could hardly tell there was  a city beckoning beyond your balcony!   The room: The beds were incredibly comfortable and the four pillows on each bed were enough to keep anyone happy.  The bedroom and bathroom were incredibly clean.

The breakfast was yummy, which a wide variety of good breakfast treats.', \"Prices have risen quite a bit in Antigua-Guatemala this past year, so the $125/night that we paid seems appropriate for the location of this boutique hotel located only 1/2 block from el Parque Centrale.  It is a very nice little hotel with several issues that will keep it from becoming a 5 Star establishment.  As previously mentioned, the location cannot be equalled. The hotel has a rustic charm and the rooms have been updated with flat screen TV's and a modern bathroom. The bed and pillows are very comfortable, and the rooms are averaged sized - but quiet.

An excellent choice.', 'We stayed here for two nights and it was a good value. Amazing cooked-to-order breakfast, lovely little garden, quite clean. Good service--the folks at the front desk found a fan for my husband that we were able to use for both nights, and they were generally friend as we came and went. (We loved the breakfast lady, she was super sweet.) Coffee, tea, and water are available all day/night, which was nice. The beds were pretty comfortable, and we were in a corner room facing the courtyard and it was incredibly quiet. The location is 5 minutes or so from the square on foot, so there are closer hotels, but I think the location is part of what made it quiet and less expensive.', \"this Hotel has a great location and it is a new construction, with new furnitures as well, it's ok for the price.  We booked the suite with jacuzzi and we paid almost a hundred dollars for it. The room is small and somewhat dark and too warm that you need to leave the windows open, so you'll listen everything from the courtyard.    The breakfast is mediocre, the staff service is poor and when we came back to the hotel from dinner (around 11pm) the front door was locked up and nobody was there to open the door.  We had to knock the door and ring the bell many times, and it happpened to the other guests as well because we could listen the door knocking during the night from our bedroom.

There are nice sitting areas, the breakfast for $5 is huge - fruit, pancakes and a cooked breakfast. Continuous coffee and water all day.

The food here is really good but also quite pricy for Guatemalan standards. There aren\\'t really other options for food around and no kitchen to use at the Earth Lodge so you depend on their pricy (but good!) restaurant. The dinners at 65Q were super good and you can normally get seconds. Breakfast and lunch was too expensive and in my opinion falsely advertised when for example the \"HUGE bowl of yoghurt and granola\" barely was what I\\'d call big.

The bathrooms were spotless & had hot showers.  Due to a lack of availability, I had no option but to stay in the six bed dorm.

She told us we would be back at 11am which would give us more than enough time to check out by 1pm.  The next day we went on the hike and by the time the tour shuttle took us back to the hotel it was 1pm.

Breakfast was great, and the kitchen staff went way out of their way to accomodate our demanding schedule.

No help was offered to find something adequate. Not even a phone call.. When we actually stayed - only because there was a much friendlier person behind the desk, all was good.  But again. We reserved for 4 nights and paid for 2. On the second day when wanting to pay for the 3. night we were told we had to move to another room and they couldnt even tell us if next day that was free. So we decided to make a move. Shame for the placem...', 'We arrived very late in the evening and were initially a little disappointed. The character of the place means it has old double wooden barn doors into a dark reception. We were allocated a bedroom with similar style doors, sparsely furnished and a small window onto a dark corridor. We just decided to get some sleep but the room whilst clean was still dark and uninviting in the morning.  We found the hotel to be built around 2 beautiful courtyards but one was definitely brighter than the other and asked to move rooms to one which was much lighter and brighter. The staff agreed and from then on the whole experience was excellent.  The gardens, although small are well tended, the dining area is very nice and the food was good.  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  The hotel', 'The hotel was excellent. The staff was very nice. The food, although was good I had other expectations from what I heard in the city. I will stay again !!!! ', 'My husband and I spent three nights of our honeymoon in Suite 7 at Meson Panza Verde. The property is gorgeous, extremely well-kept and clean, beautiful details. The grounds themselves feel like a piece of art, and we, among the lucky few, blessed to be able to glide through. Our room had a large veranda with views of the volcano to the left, visible mostly in the mornings, as in the afternoons the cloud cover ate up the view. We had an adobe fireplace, a king sized bed, and a large jacuzzi tub for two. Truly an indulgence, and perfect for a honeymoon. Be prepared to walk a lot in Antigua. Meson Panza Verde is a bit off the beaten path, around 4 long blocks to the central park. But if you are seeking privacy, and a beautiful spot to relax, Panza Verde is for you. My only two', 'I agree that this hotel is okay - great at times and terrible at others.  First, they messed up our room allocation, where I was given that grand suite and my friend the standard as the check-in staff could not speak english at all. The next day, the english speaking staff told me about the mix up and left it to me to explain to my friend, who was very gracious about it all.  Second, the restaurtant noise really is intrusiuve. Fortunately, I had sleeping pills to get me through it.  Third, the restaurant is not open Sunday evenings and Mondays. Good if you are trying to sleep.  Fourth, there was no staff around at times to help us plan our day or sort out issues.  Otherwise, a beautiful old house, very quiet during the day, big grand suite but bathroom \"window\" was next to', \"Yes, it's a nice place for families and offers a great resort style getaway in Antigua, but if you are a solo traveler this might not be the best place for you. I often felt like there were children taking over the place and while I don't mind kids (I raised a few myself) they are sometimes loud. How much this impacts you will depend upon your timing of course. They also appear to host a Sunday brunch that stretches throughout the day and has live music, people in the pool, etc... If you want quiet on a Sunday, you're out of luck.  Now, all that said, I have no real issues with the place. The room was nice (though a tad dark), I enjoyed my garden view, the food was decent, and staff were great. So in general, I recommend it, but be warned that it can be a bit loud at times.

Nice playground and clown at breakfast. Overall, we were very happy with the hotel.\", \"We spent five nights at casa florencia, with a five day trip to the lake in between. It is very sage and secure and we were able to leave the bulk of our luggage there while we visited the lake which was great.  The staff are lovely and the rooms are immaculate. Best cleaning job I've seen anywhere.  My only criticism is that because of the layout there's no common area for guests and this often resulted in noisy conversations happening right outside our room. One morning there was a big tour group who were really loud and woke us before 7am. The staff were very apologetic and even gave us a nice breakfast to apologise, but this sort of thing probably happens all the time.  It was definitely better when we had an upstairs room. I would stay there again, but only if I had an\", \"The hotel is very clean (indeed, the staff seems to be cleaning constantly) and the staff is very helpful. The location is a on the edge of the town but things are within walking distance. We were disappointed with the size of the room---with two beds and a small desk (but no desk chair) there just wasn't much room for two people, and spending any time in the room meant laying on the beds. Room size aside, the place is very pleasant, secure, and a good value (although they require payment in cash!) but next time I would choose a different hotel.\", 'A friend and I recently stayed at Meson del Valle and we really liked it! It was reasonably priced and included a home-cooked, deluxe breakfast. Denise at the front desk was fantastic - so friendly and helpful. The hotel was secure and the courtyard was inviting and relaxing. Our room was comfortable with a large bathroom. There is also a safe in the room. I liked the location of this hotel, within walking distance to everything, yet just outside of the busy streets surrounding the main square. We felt safe walking back here late at night. We passed the hotel several times, however - it is a little bit hard to spot. Antigua is great, it is beautiful. There are cool ruins, beautiful churches, good restaurants, fun shopping and nice drinking establishments as well. Dancing, too.', \"Some friends and I stayed at Hotel Meson del Valle around New Year's and while the hotel was beautiful, I do think it was worth what we paid. The staff was unfriendly and not welcoming, and the rooms were very small. But after reading others reviews perhaps the poor service we received was just poor luck on our part. Despite our experience with the staff, it does have a nice location and is peaceful and quiet.\", 'This hotel is a great weenkend escape in La Antigua, friendly staff and a good breakfast, well located.

The room was beautiful, the only issue was that there was no air conditioning and it was a little hot. Besides that everything was perfect! I would definetely recommend this hotel.

The bill itself didn't match with the price agreed upon the reservation. The final amount paid was over 50% higher than the original price.  The service itself was abhorrent. The room initially had no power in the power outlets, and inspite we told the reception, it took them a whole day to fix it. For the breakfast, we had to wait over 20 minutes to be attended, even though there weren't that many guests. The day we were leaving, we had to wait 40 minutes for one of the breakfast orders - half of which was raw - and the other never arrived.

There are dozens of first class restaurants serving dishes from around the world. Hotel La Cateredral is a small hotel with 6/8 rooms surrounding a beautiful court yard.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating, the courtyard was very relaxing and welcoming and the rooms were large and clean.   We stayed for two nights and had breakfast included. Do note to give yourself a little time for breakfast because it is made to order.   The one problem I had with the room is that the bathroom did not have a door. You could not see in to the bathroom from the bedroom but it was still rather uncomfortable. The other room belonging to the other couple we were with had a door. Maybe the hotel can put a curtain up for the rooms without the door?  All in all, a pleasant stay.', 'We stayed here for one night before heading to the lake. We got in late and left early in the am.

We stayed at the hotel 4 nights (because we had paid in advance) and it was the same every single day.', \"Casa Cristina is very nice and cute place to stay in antigua. I loved staying at the terrace and looking at the Volcan de Agua. The staffs, except the owners, could not speak Eglish but it wasn't problem at all. They were very friendly and helpful.

Overall, this place is above the average but not the best value in town.\", 'We stayed here for one-night on the last leg of our trip back to Guatemala City. Upon arrival, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. We stayed in the blue room, which was very nice. It is one of the two closest rooms to the reception area and the street. The hotel did feel safe as the entrance is always locked and you have to knock on the door, at which time they look to see who is knocking, before they let you in. When we checked into our room we were exhausted. The music playing through the hotel was so loud that we could not sleep. They were playing opera. Consequently, I took it upon myself to go into the main area where the music was coming from to turn it down. We were finally able to sleep.   The grounds of the hotel are gorgeous. It is located outside of the', 'Stayed at Posada del Angel for 2 nights visiting Antigua. We absolutely loved the hotel and thought the staff was wonderful.  The hotel is so cozy.  We stayed in the Blue Room which was great, but would choose a different room on a next visit bc the Blue Room is closer to the street and the front desk.

But instead, they just said \"the room is not clean, not until 3pm\".  The rooms are large and the decor is outdated but not bad.  It can be noisy since you need to have the windows open to cool the room down.

I couldn't walk in with my suitcase or wearing a day pack.   I would have had to unlock the second door to step straight into the room.  This would mean re-bolting that same door to leave,  so I just turned sideways to come and go.  Certainly not the easiest way to enter and leave a room; pretty to look at though not particularly useful.  This wing was also on a busy side street that was noisy at night.

To be fair I have had better steak and certainly much better coffee, but the evening was a real success, thanks to the cabaret ( it would have been even better if an extraordinarily selfish individual had not had his video camera running throughout the performance complete with a blinding light in my eyes -I hope he reads this and has a little more consideration for others in the future) If you are in Antigua you really should take in dinner here, it is an experience well worth enjoying and very good value ', 'Hotel Posada de Don Rodrigo is situated right in the centre of town, so a great base from which to wander around town. The staff was extremely helpful & friendly, and the rooms were immaculately clean & tidy (with strong wifi reception throughout)  The only downsides were a) the evening meal was a little bit disappointing and b) the local band seemed to be playing throughout the day, so there was never really much peace & quiet if you were staying in any of the rooms near the restaurant/reception!', 'We spent 3 nights at the earth lodge. The first night we spent in the treehouse. The views were breathtaking. The room a little small but the outdoor area + hammock made up for it. Plus the common area is so great, we tended not to spend a lot of time in our room anyway.  We moved the second day into the deluxe tree cabin, which we loved. The view is also spectacular, however the cabin is a little larger than the treehouse.  The communal style dinners are hearty and good value.   Staff were friendly and attentive.

The rooms were very nice and the beds extremely comfortable and well appointed. The gardens of the hotel are beautiful and the public areas in general are among the prettier I have seen. The front desk staff was very helpful. As other reviewers have said, it is a very large hotel, so there is a lot of activity all the time, including weddings and other meetings on the weekend. This just leads to a lot of activity and noise. It also means that the pool, etc., is more suited to kids than a relaxing time for adults. The restaurant was surprisingly reasonably priced and the food we had was quite good. My only significant complaint is that it was quite difficult', 'I recently spent a weekend at Porta Hotel with my wife. It had been around 25 years since I last stayed at the hotel formerly known as Hotel Antigua.

First of all, it is a nice small hotel, which I think makes it a good option for those who are looking for a quiet place to stay in. I liked that It is really close to where the action is; you just walk a couple of blocks north and get to central park and church, and many other places. The hotel has a really nice and colorful patio, in which you can find a beautiful vertical garden. The room is comfortable and according to the price you pay. Breakfast was the best: really delicious and balanced, and only for $5.

This was our first time in Antigua so we weren't completely sure if we were staying in an accessible part of town. We were in luck with Meson del Valle as it's located on 5a Avenida Sur, one of the busier streets with plenty of shops and restaurants.

The staff were all very friendly and accommodating (particularly Miguel) and we had a wonderful time. The only downside was that the walls between the rooms must have had no insulation and the people adjacent to us had two small children that yelled and cried all the time. That was incredibly annoying at night and early in the morning. They really need to think about things like\", 'A charming B & B right off the central plaza. Great value. Nice bar and lounge.

I had to take a taxi to the hotel . They did apologize and offered a free transfer back. But i made my reservation with expedia for a price and the hotel over charged me 100 dollars more . I am still in dispute but they said that the extra charges are for breakfast what is not true because i paid for the extras at my check out in a different bill.

Although the building appears to be centuries old, I believe it was constructed less than 40 years ago.

On a less favourable note, we can solely mention some noisy neighbours who have already left... and it was pure hazard, of course.', \".. but that's just my own personal quirk!  You must admit, though - they are the best!!  I digress....  Every good thing written about this wonderful hotel and the helpfulness of Marco the Day Manager is accurate.

GROUNDS: The lush courtyard was full of beautiful plants and a great seating area.  STAFF: The team that works at Good Hotel was fantastic and quick to respond to all requests.  ROOM: The room was beautiful, clean, modern. Great bed with amazing duvet and pillows. I would say that the room gets very humid and hot, even if it's cooler outside. There is also no ventilation in the bathroom, which makes the room that much more muggy.

Its within walking distance of lots of restaurants, the park, the market and plenty of other things. The owners of the hotel were friendly and helpful if we had questions about anything. One thing I really liked was the seating area on the rooftop. Great place to sit and relax, or look out over the city. Another plus was they have a computer that guests are welcome to use.

I had the room', \"As stated in previous reviews this hotel is on a quiet street near to La Merced about 5-10 minutes walk to the centre of Antigua. Unfortunately my room was at the front of the hotel facing the street and next to reception.

However, on the positive side the hotel feels very safe, with the front door kep locked at night. The rooms were clean and the shower was powerful and hot.

Ask for the 5 gallon jug of water when you check in.  It will work for two people for a week.  You cannot drink the tap water or use it for brushing teeth, so the purified water is essential.

The swimming pools are the best you can find in Antigua and the hotel offers many facilities to make your stay enjoyable. The structure, as well as the interior of the rooms is far from special, even a bit ugly. The rooms are dark but the beds are comfortable, and so is the bathroom.

It´s right in the city center and close to everything. The staff is very friendly and also the locals use this place for chic sunday breakfast/brunch. Every room is spacious, has a fireplace and a different interior. You will feel like staying in a castle with all the knight´s armor around you.

I liked the hotel very much. Our room 401 was fine, a little small but we only used it to sleep and get ready in.  No air con but we didn't need it and there is a ceiling fan.  A little noise from horses hooves at night and some cars we were across the street and our room ran along side the road, you may want to check when you book.  The breakfast buffet is lovely the lunch was good. The cocktails just okay.  The pool is lovely and there are rooms that run poolside I imagine these can be noisy with the music from the restaurant.

The resort grounds are beautiful and there is another section across and up the street. This is one of the problems of the resort. If you want to be near the dining, concierge, and the pool, you have to stay on the main side. The problem is that the restaurant music started early several mornings and went poolside some nights until 11pm! It was tough to not have interrupted sleep some mornings and nights.   The restaurant food is very good, but is overpriced on some items.  The pool area is excellent, but the pool should be retiled.

They gave us a dehumidifier to make it better.  The place is run by a few young women who were very helpful and eager to please us with breakfast and other arrangements.

The staff were delightful and the coffee amazing.  We found the noise from the interior courtyard dining area/bar (situated in the middle with rooms surrounding it) loud the evening we were there as a large group were having dinner there and the sound really carries.  Our room (10), while beautiful, seemed to have a problem with ventilation - no fan in the bathroom/window too high up to open made the whole room smell & feel moist.

The view from the roof terrace is amazing - though the short time we were there it was raining, so couldn't sit and enjoy it.   There are no restaurant/breakfast facilities, but it is close enough to various cafes and bars in town that it doesn't matter.\", \"stayed there for three nights in March.

The location could be very nice, in the middle of the fields, in the hills, facing the volcanoes, close to Antigua. But it is not!

As long as the window was closed on the front of the room it was very quiet.  So, bring ear plugs during the week.  On weekends the street is blocked off to traffic so it is quieter.

Because the hotel has a section across the street from the main area, we appreciated the security presence at each entrance at night as there were many girls walking back and forth. This hotel offers a scenic swimming pool with wonderful volcano views, rose gardens and courtyards throughout, and well-stocked vats of purified water. The rooms, though dark, were comfortable, tastefully decorated and included a spacious bathroom.  The front desk also exchanged money for us without a fee – so much better than going to a bank.  Hotel was in a great location, easy walking distance to the city square and great restaurants.', \"Although a large complex that seemed overwhelming to navigate at first, the hotel is a beautiful escape from the town of Antigua. Similar to other four or five star hotels in Antigua, Porta has well-manicured grounds, fountains and courtyards. In the three days that I stayed, there was always someone sweeping or tending to the landscaping.  The pools are beautiful and the lap pool is very secluded. The rooms in the new section of the hotel are quiet and spacious. All of the hotel staff are welcoming and helpful. The breakfast buffet offered both traditional Guatemalan and American-style food. Everything was delicious. I'm looking forward to returning in the future.  \", 'Great place, good price including a delicious and fresh breakfast daily, clean bathrooms and comfortable accomodations, friendly and helpful staff, very well located. I stayed in a private room upstairs by the terrace where you can relax in a hammock', 'This hotel is absolutely beautiful and quaint.   The beds are comfortable and the staff is very friendly.  We only ate breakfast at the hotel but everything we tried was delicious.  The chef is creative and does an excellent job.  The reason I am giving this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is that upon checking we were given a room with one king size bed instead of two double beds even though we had reserved one with two beds.  Once we brought this to their attention they immediate switched us rooms.  The other reason is that the shower head in our room did not work and even though we let them know, it was never fixed.    I highly recommend the Spa at their sister property.  It is truly a 5 star spa.  ', \"Improvement needed. I understand this is not a five star, major chain hotel, but it needs to have their basics covered. During checkout time, I had to dig in for cash to pay for laundry. They hire an outside service, and ask their guests to pay in cash on a separate bill, making it annoying if you don't have any cash.  They would not take a credit card to pay for laundry, so I could not check out until I found cash. They should take credit a card payment for all services rendered. Front door to my room was lose, and very difficult to lock from the inside. After trying for a couple minutes, I just simply gave up and went to sleep with an open door during all my stay. You can however, lock it from the outside.  I did not report it because I would not spend any time inside, and did\", \"With the Central Park just four blocks away, Casa Cristina is a charming place to stay without being right on top of the late night craziness.  The hotel has a 24-hour security guard so although guests are not provided with a key to the building, access is always available.  We reserved and paid a deposit through Pay Pal and then paid (cash only but USD and Quetzales both accepted) the balance upon arrival.  Pay the extra $10 US and stay in the top floor rooms for the stellar views of Volcan Fuego.  Clean rooms each have TVs with many channels, and the showers have hot water (but don't linger).  No restaurant in this hotel but there are a ton within walking distance.\", \"This is a beautiful hotel and conference center that looks amazing and very professional. We had good rates based on the rooms being bundled with a Pullman bus package. We were pleasantly surprised by the grand appearance of the hotel and grounds but soon found that some of our expectations were not met. They obviously cater to large groups and convenitions and if you don't mind routine buffet food and lining up for large dining rooms it will probably suit quite well.  We  found the food to be much better downtown near Central Park and much more varied and reasonable. The good news is that there is a free shuttle to Central Park several times a day and it is a very easy walk.  There is no free WiFi and it cost the equivalent of seven dollars per day per device and is strictly\", \"We recently stayed here with a small group from the US on a missions trip. This hotel is a great bargain and the quality is great. We had clean rooms and hot showers. There is soccer, tennis, ping pong and 2 swimming pools available for use!   We didn't get to try out the Spa, but heard great things about it.   Antigua is safe to walk around in but always take at least one person with you. Make sure to check out the local market square and the great restaurants near by.   You definitely won't regret staying here!\", \"My husband and I stayed at Soleil for one week through the Interval World timeshare exchange program. We got pretty much what we expected after reading reviews on Trip Advisor, and we had a comfortable and pleasant experience. It's definitely one of the nicer hotels in Antigua, so if you're looking for an American 5 star experience, Guatemala probably isn't the vacation spot for you. The hotel offers a delicious array of food in it's two cafes and restaurant, though it's definitely pricier than establishments in downtown Antigua. The two pools and tennis courts are nice, though they could be cleaned up somewhat. One thing we noticed is that this hotel tends to nickel-and-dime a bit. You have to pay for just about every convenience - not much is included with the cost of the\", 'This seems to be a place for locals (especially the 20 something crowd) to get out of the city and enjoy a night or two in the hills.  That we can appreciate.  Nice view and a decent dinner but aside from that, not much else to compliment.    We received a luke-warm greeting upon arrival and really only one of the staff members was smiling and friendly.  Obnoxiously loud music playing all day and into the night in the communal area - completely detracted from the quiet/secluded nature of the place.  Accommodations & bathrooms/showers were simple - we can dig that as we are simple people but there didn\\'t seem to be much care towards them.

However, from the moment that you enter the foyer, you become aware that you are in a special place. The building itself is architecturally interesting with a mix a wood, stone, tile, brick, colorful plaster, and lots of foliage, fresh cut flowers and candles. The inside common areas and rooms blend seamlessly with the outdoors. There is a charming common sitting area with fireplace across from a small but pristine plunge pool. The upstairs common rooftop patio has lots of comfortable furniture and view of a volcano...great spot to read a magazine and get some sun!  We stayed in the Mayan room for 4 nights. The bedroom is very small...smaller than it appears on the website and much tinier than every other room. It is the only\", \"Earth Lodge is situated at elevation outside the lovely city of Antigua and has stunning views over the surrounding hills and volcanos and is worth a visit just for the views alone. Good food is available in the bar, but there are no faciliies to prepare or store your own food. I stayed there recently and at 9.45pm all guests were turned out of the only communal area because 'no one was using the bar', be warned, it gets very cold up there and a chilly, ill lit dorm may not be your choice of place to spent the evening. It seems that once they have had your money you are no longer useful to them. Bad attitude to travellers who are obviously on a budget or they wouldn't be in a hostel in the first place.\", \"I have stayed at the Don Rodrigo on numerous occasions and am always impressed by the beauty of the place. This visit I and my buddy (who travel to Antigua after fishing in Puerto San Jose) were given room 102 which turned out to be on the side street next to the hotel. The noise was disturbing and we were gladly and expeditiously moved first thing  the next morning. (If you are a light sleeper avoid the exterior rooms to the right side of the court yard.) As I am a frequent visitor I also negotiated a discount and the comp breakfast. ( try the macadamia pancakes and the fruit plate both are magnificant!)

I'll stay\", \"The hotel was in a great location - easy walking to many places in Antigua (a fabulous town).  The staff was very friendly and helpful - BUT - before you check into your room, you might want to check it out, because there is a corridor of rooms that has windows onto the street and it is like staying at a truck stop.  VERY noisy.  Our party had two rooms -the other room didn't have street noise,but people stayed up late and talked LOUDLY at the charming seating areas that were all over.  Other than that, beds were comfy enough - hot running water - worth a stay.\", 'We spent two nights in a spacious suit with a beautiful view. I liked the TV room with the fireplace, it was cosy and silent. We felt like home. There was continuous service of Port vine at the TV room.   The bathroom was disfunctional, no privacy at all, especially when you are a family.   I think the restaurant can improve its ambiance.  Overall it was a pleasent trip and i am looking forward to going back in summer to try the rooftop pool.', 'The hotel is 10min walking distance from the Central Place. 100 large and very comfortable rooms (2 large beds, large bathroom). Garden and common areas are very well finished. Good restaurant for dinner. I would have preferred a buffet breakfast.

It is on a quiet street, but conveniently located about a seven minute walk from the center of Antigua. The staff speaks English (most of them) and are courteous and helpful. Our room was comfortable, and had nice touches like in room purified water and a coffee maker. Breakfast was delicious. The centrally located pool was a nice treat!', \"After living in Antigua for a month, my apartment lease was up and I decided to stay here for 2 nights...my last 2 nights in Antigua. I chose it because it was close to my father's Spanish school where he was staying and visiting and a place with a nice pool and (supposedly) wifi throughout the common areas so that I could work and enjoy the amenities simultaneously.  I booked into a regular room - with tax coming to about 160.00/night.   Upon arrival I was taken across the street (this is awkward if you are going back and forth from the pool to your room - walking across the street....eek!) to a room which was situated in a small part of the outdoor hallway that was covered...The room, because of this, was very dark and cave-like... fine, perfect for sleeping (I really needed\", \"I liked the hotel amenities. I didn't like that we were not in the main hotel building, we were across the street. We asked to be moved, but were told there weren't any rooms at the rate level we had. I booked a deluxe room and thought it would be air conditioned, it wasn't. I was offered a premium room with air conditioning for $40/night more. The nights in March in Antigua are cool enough that we didn't need A/C but I wouldn't want to stay in this room in July.\", 'Very nice hotel, comfortable rooms, decent food (not exceptional), very service oriented staff. Couple of items to look after: rooms do NOT have A/C and Antigua can get very hot with extreme high humidity, and you suffer through it. Also a minibar/coffee machine would enhance de experience.', \"The service and breakfast were excellent.  The entire staff went out of their way to accomodate the odd schedule we were operating on.  The rooms varied greatly - we stayed in both room 6 and room 8 on our two stays in antigua.  Room six is pretty dark and being on the street a bit noisy.  Room eight was brighter and very quiet - an interior room.  Don't expect hot water - it does get warm after a while but that's it. The location is perfect.\", 'We ended up staying at Casa Cristina for four nights as it proved to be a handy base for exploring sights in the region around Antigua. We stayed in the queen room downstairs, which was spacious and clean, and there were hot showers... most of the time. The staff were friendly and speak English and German which helps if your Spanish is limited! The internet was very slow though.', \"At first glance we were really happy with this hotel, the staff were friendly and the room was cozy.  After 2 weeks without a proper hot water shower, it was really nice to have a good shower in a clean bathroom.  However, after the first night my friend woke up with ominous looking bites all over her arms.  We later found a bed bug on her clothing.  We asked to be moved and had no further problems with bugs.    However, the staff did not seem to believe that the bites came from their bed.   We showed the bug to  a couple of members of staff, who laughed at us.  My friend was really cross by this point and extremely itchy.

Enjoyed the cable and the hot water in the bathroom.  You have use of a hotel computer to check e-mail, and there's coffee (instant) and sweet breads for guests in the morning.  The roof patio was a nice play to sit, with great views of the volcanos and La Merced.\", 'We stayed here for 2 nights on May 25-26. The hotel is about 3 blocks from the central but we can easily walk or take a tuk tuk for $2 when we want to to into town. The room is clean, comfortable with garden view and it has a fireplace. For breakfast, everything is not readily available like other hotels, a waiter will come and ask for your order instead. Overall, a comfortable hotel but not as special as other hotels we stayed in Guatemala.', 'I stayed here april for a beach volleyball tournament.  Having been to guatemala city before, I was not expecting much this time around in terms of accommodation.  I was pleasantly surprised when the hotel was very beautiful and rooms were great.  The beds were so comfortable.  Luckily it wasnt too hot outside because there was no AC.  Wifi was 5$ us a daynwhich is reasonble.  Meals in the restaurant were good.  The location was perfect!

Our unit #301 was a couple of minutes walk to the pool.  The lap pool was a bit on the green side and really needed painting.

Go there stressed, and you will leave refreshed.', 'The hotel is located minutes from the cathedral, and is on the main street in Antigua. The rooms were large and comfortable. The staff was super friendly. We had a 4:00 am transport to the airport in the morning - so they made sure they had breakfast for us to go, without us even asking for it. It was a bit cold at night, and they gave us a heater for the room. The views from the restaurant on the top were gorgeous. The courtyard was lovely with a band playing music.', \"We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour with Friendly Planet.  Nice hotel that was apparently a former residence and certainly one of the historic buildings in the area.  Actually had room keys (kind of a skeleton key) to lock the room door.  Big bathroom with a nice shower.  Rooms weren't very quiet but that wasn't really an issue.  Near the town square and plenty of good restaurants.  Breakfast at the hotel was quite good, with local fare and fresh tortillas being made right there in front of you.\", 'very good. the location was really convenient closed to the city center, though Antigua is very small city. room was clean and comfortable. room service menu should have more variation. we are interested in the other location of Camino Real.', \"I began planning my trip to Guatemala many months in advance and Casa Florencia Hotel was one of the first hotels I contacted via email as a 'starting point' for my adventures. The service I received?  Unsurpassed! Patricia was incredibly attentive, helpful and very honest. She now holds the record for best customer service I've received from hotels worldwide. I was looking for a big, bright spacious room and she was upfront in telling me the rooms on the bottom floor were lacking in natural lighting but were nice nonetheless. I appreciated her honesty!  I had many questions regarding Semana Santa, taxis from the airport, location of the hotel, etc. and Patricia usually answered my emails if not the same day, the next. How refreshing! She arranged taxi service for me so I was in\", \"This was our second visit to Porta Hotel Antigua. I don't think our kids could imagine staying anywhere else in Antigua. This time we had a room adjacent to the lap pool, which was a great amenity. The room was a good size, with a nice, modern bathroom and a fireplace. The property in general is lovely, and it's within walking distance to most everything in town. Just a few blocks to the park. My kids like the playground and the guacamayas. Breakfasts are outstanding. Food at lunch was good too, though the service was a bit slow and special requests (ex. no lettuce) weren't consistently accommodated. Also, you can request a children's menu and a sandwich menu. Kudos to Claudia who was helpful as concierge. We would not hesitate to recommend Porta, and we hope to return.\", 'From the street, this doesn\\'t appear to be a hotel.

I don't really care too much about the size of the room as I'm out on the town for most of the day anyways.  The bathrooms were very clean but they were downstairs. The upstairs terrace was nice and quiet with a couple hammocks and some couches. One of the ladies at the front desk spoke excellent English was helpful with booking shuttle buses and whatnot.

It Is built around a courtyard, which, when not filled with people, is quite pleasant. The rooms are modest sized, but extremely dark. The restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor dining. The food is good, but not outstanding. The issue that concerned us most was the hubbub of activity, particularly noticeable on weekends. The active street life (which we very much enjoyed) spilled into the hotel courtyard, which also serves as a favored locale for weddings and celebrations.

Kitchen looked decent, didn't get to use it, but it's very small, honestly difficult for more than one person to be in there.  Service isn't much to speak of, but whatever.  Good breakfast.

Manager was delayed in initial response, but eventually replied.  When I needed to prepay, manager was also slow in response, but finally gave request for paypal payment within 3 days of trip.

The hostel arranged the transfer for us from Antigua which cost us 10Q each (about a quid) and it takes about 20 minutes or so.

The only downside was that it was terribly cold that weekend and the cabin didn't seem to retain any heat whatsoever.  That being said, the staff were friendly and outgoing; sort of.  The one thing that we found really frustrating was that you have to eat the food that they are preparing if you want to stay there.  That would have been fine with me if I was vegetarian and I was not allergic to almost everything on the plate.  So I ended up having to pay for a meal that I couldn't even eat.

Cons: -Lap pool has no fountain/ie movement so lots of mosquitos hang out there-not good if you are in the green room.  -They need a fountain-small shared spaces need some kind of background noise. -Bathroom was not so great- shower has no place for soap and with no door water gets everywhere.  -Biggest complaint is that the weekend we were there Simon was the only one there- and he spoke no english.

I decided to call back again, and was told that I needed to send an email. I explained that I had already tried and never received a response, but did so again anyway and received a prompt reply.

I was most disappointed with the front desk staff who were not very friendly (no eye contact) and non responsive to my requests.

We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant which is semi open air looking out over a courtyard.  Only a couple of issues: we were travelling with our teenage sons and had two rooms - normally I would have expected those rooms to be at least close to each other but in fact they were in different parts of the hotel.

The hotel is a whole resort area, with low buildings, pleasant inner spaces, a nice garden with tropical flowers and an open swimming pool.

After I upped it to maximum, about a day later, I finally got the waters we bought cold.  The  kitchen cabinets were locked but they finally came and unlocked them.

Our room was upstairs and was comfortable and quiet at night and the bathroom had a good shower with plenty of hot water.  The staff were friendly and helpful at all times.  The hotel is quite small and the location is just a little bit out of the way, which is both a plus and a minus - it is a bit quieter than placer closer to the center, but a little bit more of a walk to get to the main areas of shops and restaurants.  It is a small, simple and a no-frills place, but a very good value for the reasonable price of the rooms.', 'The staff was great and they do their best to make you feel at home. It is clean and cute. The hotel is really a small house, so expect a little noice.', 'We had a conference here and it was a good base for the meetings with well laid out grounds.   the breakfast and foo was ok but not great.   They did have a reasonable coffee shop.   The rooms where big and had great space.   The beds comfortable and quiet.   The gym was a bit to small and without much gear.     Beautiful gardens.', 'Stayed at the Porta Hotel Antigua in May and was very happy.   The hotel is everything you could want, very clean, great food, beautiful views and grounds, and a great location (a few streets over from the central park).  The staff was very friendly and helpful and we felt very well taken care of.   We used their transfers to get to and from the airport and everything went without a hitch.  The van was waiting for us when we walked out of the airport and was punctual taking us back.  It was modern, in good shape, and air-conditioned.  Check-in was easy, no hassle there.    The rooms were nice, spacious, and very comfortable.  The Porta Hotel Antigua is actually a couple of buildings connected by underground walkways, which is pretty cool.  Our room was probably the farthest you', \"I had a wonderful stay at Hotel La Catedral but was disappointed in how I was treated after the trip.  I had to leave a day early which the manager knew about two days in advance.  He told me that I'd have to wait until after my trip and straighten it out with expedia.  However, when I called expedia to get my refund the manager in talking with expedia would not give the refund.  I would have stayed the extra night rather than booking a hotel  in Guatamala City if I knew I would not get a refund.  I was treated warmly while on the property but that all changed when I was no longer there.  I did not expect to be treated so dishonestly.\", 'We had been given one night at this hotel as a gift from friends. My partner and I decided to extend our stay one night and had an anniversary weekend away. Our friends requested their particular room for us because they loved it so much.  When we arrived, we were informed we had been upgraded to a better room.  Unfortunately the reality was that they had a wedding there and juggled the rooms for them and the room we got was dark and very unimpressive. The whirl pool bath was outside on a bleak cement patio, the living room had two overstuffed chairs, a flatscreen TV, an empty hutch, no art on the walls and even though it had a fireplace, it was empty no one cared about the appearance. Just as a heads up it #5, avoid it.  They are also changing the name to El Pensativo Hotel.

The food was okay nothing out of the ordinary.  After trying their dinner I decided not to try their breakfast.  The service was excellent all personal was very attentive and helpful.', 'I had heard so many wonderful things about the Earth lodge and was realy excited about spending some quality time there relaxing. I emailed the lodge to enquire if they had accomodation and they replied nearly straight away stating they had. i emailed again to confirm the accomodation and arrange transfers there, as is recommended on their website. To my great disappointment i did not receive an email in reply. I sent the email again and tried calling the lodge twice but could not get through. To this date, a week later I have yet to hear from the lodge. Very disappointing!!', \"I enjoyed my stay (fortunately, someone else was paying for my stay). If I were paying for this place, I would imagine I would feel even less enthused about this review. The location cannot be beat! The hotel's interior has a lot of history, as do the rooms (which are not very comfortable). Also, the hotel feels too kitschy.\", 'We stayed in a private room (with shared bathroom) for a few nights... It is a very quiet and very clean hostel - with the best free breakfast we had during our entire 5 month trip! Definitely a great place to use as your base whilst exploring the city!

Make sure you get a room on the upper floor, it's much nicer up there.  Just one thing about the travelagency. We booked a shuttle to St. Marco at Lago Atitlan and the driver wanted to set us off at another village after sunset and let us continue with a Tuktuk.

It needed a lot af argueing so that he brought us to St marco...\", 'We have stayed in Yellow hostel for 2 days, in one of the private rooms upstairs which was quiet, but I can not say the same about the rooms downstairs as they start preparing the breakfast really early and you may find them noisier.  The breakfast is really good, although not consistent as one day we have had our omelette with cheese and tomato - one day without. The location is quite good - within walking distance to the center of the town.  What really stands for this place is that you have to pay for everything : if you want to reserve the room - you have to pay in advance (with commissions supported by yourself), you want a towel - you pay for it as well as a deposit, if your shuttle does not appear and you ask them to make a call - you pay 3QTZ probably well above what', 'I wish I had tried their breakfast which looked delicious, but I had to leave early and still they gave me some fruit and coffee... I tried to stay there again but it was full.  I definitely recommended.', \"I stayed here while visiting some friends. I didn't mind the size of the room. The shower issues, were a little annoying, you can't come back from going out and take a shower (late at night) because the owner goes to bed and they shut the boiler/heater off. Also the roach problem in the room where I stayed was terrible. I saw roaches on the floor, bathroom, wall, nigtstand... I was fortunate enough not to have paid for that night yet, so late and all, I was leaving to another hotel, when the guy in charge of the door at night called the owner, who told me that I had to pay for that night even though we'd had the roach problem and couldn't take a shower. I wasn't going to do that! I think a good hotel owner should recognize when there is a problem and try to make the client feel\", 'this hotel is very safe and comfortable  the ppl are very helpful  nice location  my friend and I enjoyed the stay  with hot water and internet access', \"I guess if you want to be away from the main square and surrounded by kids,  this is the place for you. There is a shuttle to the main square but it is infrequent. The fireplace is a nice touch and def. not decorative - it gets cold at night. Good if you have kids, and want a buffer between you and the country, i guess. It might also be a nice treat to use the incredible spa after hiking if you're doing that - whirlpool to wash the knots away. Otherwise, look elsewhere.\", \"The hotel offers a shuttle service not every hour but a few enough. Plenty of parking. The swimming pool was nice and warm the one with the slide can be a lot of fun for the kids they play music the kind you expect at a classic guatemala bar.  They have live marimba for lunch buffet now the food is horrible! I think the price you pay is probably the fact they have two big pools but this hotel is lacking on the charm of the city. If you really want a colonial and very peaceful experience then I wouldn't recommend the hotel if you have kiddos and they need a pool to.release energy and cool off then this hotel is for you.\", 'I just returned from a week-long stay at Soleil.  The entire staff worked exceptionally hard to accommodate all requests.  This was a timeshare exchange ( for my Disney Vacation Club).  While not on a par with Disney properties, the unit was well furnished with kitchenette (stove top, frig, cookware, microwave), a large living room, bedroom and bath.  Twice, however, there was no hot water for showers.  No potable water, but for $5, a large 5 gallon water dispenser was provided that lasted two people the entire week.  The Thai spa was quiet and  attractive with expert personnel.  A buffet breakfast was good, but the same each day.  We ate one dinner which was very good in the main restaurant. Bath and bed linens were a little worn, but clean.  The landscaped grounds were', 'we stayed at this hotel as part of a time share swap. The hotel is nice with a lot of amenities. We asked and they recommended a tour operator in the hotel: Acova Tour. Owned by Javier Corona. he did an excellent job setting up 7 days of tours including Antigua and Tikal and Lake Atitlan. His guides spoke excellent english and what we liked most was his suggestions and then his willingness to adjust as we communicated back and forth to prepare for the trip. He was flexible and made excellent suggestions. One of our group of 4 had mobility problems and Javier worked out all of the necessary adjustments. He made the trip a terrific and safe experience.', \"The hotel is has its charm. I liked the fact that our room had its very own fireplace. The hotel grounds are nicely kept and although a bit dated, the bathroom was clean and the room as comfortable. The only drawback to this hotel would be the location. I would have preferred to stay at a place more in the center of town. The hotel is located about a 10-15 walk from the main plaza. Even though it's not a long walk it's still annoying to have to walk back in sometimes lonely roads after dinner in the center of town.  We booked this hotel because it was a part of a great deal. Overall, good hotel but i think i will choose another one next time.\", 'My first Hotel in Antigua!  Nice hotel even if the room was very small and difficult to move around with case and bags ( room n.1).  The room was looking on the court, simply beautiful with flowers, coach, plants and more!

Breakfast with a choice among continental, local, american breakfast and more!!! Only one problem...little bit humid..........', \"It is the location that really makes this place stand out. You will not get a better view than this - absolutely amazing!  My other half and I stayed in the Treehouse for 3 nights. It's very basic (although you do have electricity in there) and very secluded, perfect for a relaxing and romantic getaway. Apparently the other cabins are much bigger and nicer (and a lot closer to the main building and the hot showers), but we were happy with the Treehouse. The bed was incredibly comfy and the view from the bed is incredible.  Breakfast was available between 8 and 10am (if I remember right) and was very tasty, if a bit pricey for Guatemala. Coffee is horrid - go down to Antigua to have a real coffee. Dinners were served communal style and there was plenty of nice veggie food on\", \"This is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed at. Abundance of colonial genius loci, literally every room is different in layout and decoration with antique furniture. A splendid view from terrace over rooftops of Antigua Guatemala, Volcán de Fuego and Volcán de Agua dominating the scene. So even when there is no buffet breakfast (you have to make your choice from menu containing mostly eggs), there is no spa or pool I am pretty sure you won't care for night or two. Located very coveniently close to main square and other landmarks, it's perfect starting point for attractions in Antigua Guatemala. Go and give it a try!\", 'Very Nice staff, cool room opening on to.beautiful interior courtyard.

The property is well kept and most of the staff I interacted with were polite,friendly, and helpful. There is also free wifi all over the hotel and a restaurant on the property, it has similar features to US hotels. The only downside was not being able to check-in early. I am not sure if it was a just a fluke or standard policy, I arrived about 2 pm but I had to wait till 3pm to check-in.', 'We visited during Semana Santa and rates were high and availiblity was limited.  Though I started searching in December, I was put off by some of the high rates.  I was asked by Hotel Cristina to pay in advance via paypal and to commit for four days.    The rooms are very, very small, even the \"deluxe\" rooms.  There is no courtyard, which is common in Antigua.  Many of the rooms have windows only on the hallway and if you want air, you have to open the window to the hallway and other guests can watch you sleep.  The noise from other guests is also a problem.  My son, who slept downstairs, reported he could hear me snore upstairs.    I was disappointed in the quality of the baths (very small, shower curtain too short to contain the water) and there are one or two rooms with a TV', 'We had the chance to stay 3 times in Casa Cristina during our trip in Guatemala, for us it was just what we needed! A small tipical hotel, very well situated on a small street near \"La Merced church\", it was clean, very secure, pleasant and calm with free internet and for such a reasonnable price, really we could not ask for more. The owners and the staff were always very helpfull, the last time we had the deluxe room on the 3rd floor with large windows with a beautifull view of the volcano .Without hesitation I would recommend it to any of my friend who would be planing a visit to Antigua for a few days.

One with a double bed which was so small the door did not even open all the way. One of the other rooms had two beds but was very small as well. The only window was a high two foot window that opened to a concrete ventilation shaft, and the shower dripped all night.

Beautiful grounds and the one bedroom units were quite spacious, but a bit worn. The staff was very helpful, but the answers to my questions kept changing. I was told three times there would be a full Thanksgiving dinner in the restaurant. By the time I got back from my tour that day, went down to dinner and no Thanksgiving. And of course, it was too late to make reservations anywhere else. I realize it’s not their holiday, but so many Americans were there that week, and hotels serve it all over the world. If they were not going to have it, they should have told me, and I would have made alternative arrangements. Also the travel agency in the hotel is not as accommodating to solo travelers as I would have wished. Not their fault,', 'We have done a lot of travelling and have seldom if ever found a cleaner hotel than this.  The staff are extremely polite, rooms comfortable, view spectacular from the veranda.  It is a bit quieter as it is a 10 minute walk from the centre of Antigua.  Safety/security seems to be a priority for the hotel staff and we certainly felt very safe. We highly recommend this hotel.', 'We were allocated to a clean, small sized room with a fresh looking bed. It was adequate for our 2 nights stay. The staff were attentive and friendly. The internet was free and fast service.Packed breakfast was a bit too simple with slice of bread, an apple and a drink!', \"The location and amenities this hotel offers are wonderful.  Just one block off the central plaza, close to all the wonderful sites the city of Antigua has to offer.  The rooms were very clean and decorated beautifully.  The bed in our room was huge (Room #2) with wonderful sheets and pillows.  The bathroom was extremely clean with a large mirror and plenty of space.  We had some trouble with water pressure but the hotel showed great concern and fixed the problem promptly.   Breakfasts were wonderful and eating under the covered patio each morning was a treat.  Make sure to visit the VIP Lounge (adjacent to the courtyard) for one of the smoothest margarita you'll ever taste or a cold Gallo . . . a wonderful way to end your day of exploring Antigua.\", \"Hotel experience was very unique.  From the outside, the hotel looks average but inside was really nice and cozy.  The rooms in the main hotel are big but without airconditioning, some have ceiling fans.  I requested to move to a room with airconditioning and I was transferred to another building. The building had poor lighting inside the hallways and it was scary going to my room which was at the very end of the building. I didnt' feel like going out again once I got inside my bedroom especially at night.   Staff were very nice and extremely helpful.  The souvenir stores are 4 blocks away and the central park is within walking distance.    Overall, I'd recommend this hotel.\", 'Pleasantly surprised does not cover my reaction when walking into the courtyard of this hotel. I love the open air atmosphere that this hotel exudes. The staff was very nice and friendly. The rooms were large and spacious. Now granted we were there in the \"rainy season\" and did not need air, but i did love the little windows in the door frame you could pop open for circulation. The pool was heated and the garden surrounding it, very relaxing. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was our last night at dinner.

Well both the service and food was not great. I\\'m not sure if it had anything to do', 'Quiet and charm place, to be relax at night and enjoy delicious meals!

Maybe the upstairs volcano view rooms are much better (I'd be willing to consider that using the coupon was part of my mistake.)  Also, the hotel is pretty far off the plaza and off the beaten track in Antigua (which the reviews do make clear.)

We spent our days at an orphanage, so returned each night exhausted and didn't have the energy to venture out of the hotel. With seven waiters to help maybe five diners, the service should have been great.  We would ask for bread 4 times at about 5 minute intervals before it would appear. Everything would be an ordeal. We would marvel at how busy they were at doing nothing. Four people were always enthralled at two computers.  Our needs were never anticipated and they didn't seem to recognize us from morning to evening or day to day. One morning, I asked for tres coffee con leche, then my friend asked for the same.

I love the grounds, which are gated and maintained beautifully with all manner of flora, fountains and seating along the pathway to rooms.

The property is maintained adequately and most things appeared to be in working condition. I have had problems twice during the first week, returning to my room only to have the keys not work.

Very nice external environment like an old Spanish \"hacienda\" with internal gardens and two kinds of buildings: old and new ones. Depending of which one you choose, rooms are more or less comfortable. There are a couple of pools of hot water. One potential problem is that in the bathroom there is no \"real\" pure water, that is not important as usually no one drinks it, but it is somehow uncomfrotable to brush your teeth or take a shower.', 'I picked this property based on the recommendations posted in Tripadvisor. I am happy I did! This is a very comfortable and laid back property. Although it is close to the centre of Antigua, it is very quiet. I enjoyed everything in this place. The room, the breakfast, the service, it is all good. I will certainly stay here again. The only minor glitch that I think the property owners should fix is the hot water system in the room. It is not friendly and it wastes lots of water while it reaches an acceptable temperature.

Although the location was beautiful, we were disappointed with our overall stay and checked out after one night.   We were overall disappointed with the attitude of the staff and even though we understand the chilled out backpacker vibe thing, we just found them to be aloof and generally unhelpful. The Chirstmas eve dinner was disappointing as the food was average and the management did not seem interested in hosting the event.   The location is beautiful, set on a hill overlooking Antigua and the surrounding farmland and volcanoes. There is a nice chilled out atmosphere and places to sit to enjoy the view.  The cabins were fully booked so we stayed in a tent supplied by Earth Lodge. It was reasonably', \"We booked a hiking trip through Old Town to the Earth Lodge. Walking into the lodge is like walking into a picnic.. People were eating, playing games, talking and lounging in the hammocks.

We had homemade pizza and salad the night we were there with carrot cake for dessert. Delicious. The cabins are sparse but comfortable and the restrooms are outside.. very clean and hot water for the shower.\", \"- Easy to get to, only a 10 min ride from Antigua in Otto's truck for 50 Q total - Fantastic views over Antigua and the vulcanoes, with small glimts into Guatemalan rural life - Good food, made locally with home-grown avocados - Relaxed atmosphere, great for meeting other travellers with different travelling styles - The treehouse was definitely worth the experience. Also, the dorms are cheap and relatively cozy in apperance.  - Try out the wood-fired Mayan sauna on site (but give it a few hours to heat up - staff will help you with that :) - In sum: If you want a different experience, either for a day or longer, Earth Lodge is definitely worth a visit!\", 'I love this place, is a lovely hotel, the rooms are awesome, is like been in the past, the breakfast is my favorite with the really good coffe best frut just in front of a beautiful garden, I can´t wait to go back!!!', 'I stayed here for one night enroute from Lake Atitlan to Tikal (Antigua is only an hour from the Guatemala City airport if  you aren´t travelling during rush hours). This hotel was recommended to me by my local Guatemalan guide and was a last minute booking.   Staff was very friendly and helpful.  For $80 I had a large room in a private courtyard with 4 other rooms. It had a small double bed and a small TV and a very nice and modern shower and separate toilet. There were no cupboards or hanging space but I didn´t need it.

It is located by the Arch which is a very good location. The staff is excellent. I found the restaurant to be very good with a nice view of an inner courtyard. Having said that, the fact is it is not up to the standards that I am used to when staying at Casa Florencia. First, unlike Casa Florencia, there are no ceiling fans in the rooms, which can make it a little stuffy. Second, there was dust on the chairs outside my rooms, something you would NEVER see (read the reviews) at Casa', \"Stayed at Porta Hotel Antigua for 8 days. Found it to be clean and well kept.

A few comments: 1. It is not far at all to the city center. Maybe a 10 - 15 minute walk and they have a free shuttle. The tuk tuk is about $3 - $4 (american) and we took that at night when coming back from the city center, but otherwise felt very safe walking.   2. We exchanged through RCI timeshare. The room is for sure not what you would find in the U.S. for a timeshare. Our week there were no rooms w/ kitchens available so we had just a small room with a fireplace when we walked in and it overlooked the pool. That wasn't ideal for us, but they said they had no other rooms available.

There are a bunch of additional rules, communicated via notices in the room: no loud noises, instructions on volume at which to close your door, that kind of thing.  There is no breakfast available - except on Saturday, when you must eat the breakfast there, it's compulsory: another rule.  The place is absolutely spotless.

On the day we had to leave at 4:30am for a side trip to Tikal, they arranged a take-along breakfast for us.  I noticed throughout our stay how often we'd see one of the staff sweeping floors and generally keeping the surroundings spotless.  They obviously take pride in their hotel, and with good reason.

The room was large and comfortable.  However we had room 103 and were wakened every morning at 5am by traffic right outside our window.  I would suggest asking for a room 110 or higher.

There is a computer downstairs for guests to use but it has time restrictions - 8pm I think.  The rooms were comfy enough - fairly basic but clean and the hotel was well kept. However for $50 a night I would expect breakfast.   The staff at Casa Florencia were lovely and very responsive via email. They were very helpful with anything we asked. The hotel was a little far from the main square but we didn't mind the walk since it's a charming city.  We returned to Antigua 2 months later and just couldn't justify staying here again.

As previously posted, the rooms upstairs share a common balcony with great views and plenty of light. The rooms downstairs share a common terrace with a fountain and shady garden.  I would definitely recommend asking for a room upstairs since you get the views and great light and they're the same price as those downstairs.

The hotel is located slightly away from the main centre of Antigua, but by no means is it out of the way - a short 15 minute walk and you're in the Parque Central.  There is also a free shuttle bus that runs three times a day into the centre, with an extremely friendly and accommodating driver if the walk's too far.  The bonus of being slightly out of the centre means the hotel is spacious, and allows for two pools within the grounds.  The pools were great for relaxing after a sweaty day site-seeing, and a real plus for the hotel.  Other reviews have said they found them filthy - the pools are outdoors and open to the elements, they were cleaned daily and well maintained by the staff but there's only so much\", 'Stayed at Soleil Antigua during \"Semana Santa\" (Easter) 2010 for 3 nights. The entire stay was a nightmare. We knew before that the hotel was a considerable walk from the Anigua Guatemala city center, so this is not a complaint. In fact, the only pleasant thing about our stay was the courteous hotel shuttle driver. The bathroom, room and carpet were old and outdated, in need of major maintenance. Our toilet overflowed continuously, and the staff and management did not respond to any of our numerous complaints. Every morning, our bathroom floor was a small lake, due to all the overflowed, so much so, that we apologized to the cleaning lady/ The restaurant is good, but extremely overpriced, when compared to much better options in Antigua.

There is no heat or air conditioning in the rooms.  There is a fireplace, with real wood to use if you get cold.  The rooms are pretty large, but very little furniture.  The walls are very thin and you can hear everything in the hallways and in other rooms.  Also, some of the rooms have carpets and others do not.    On the weekends the hotel turns into a loud music fiesta with booming music, games by the pool and entertainment.  It is impossible to relax or take a nap from 10am to 5pm.

In addition, two of the nights we stayed there they had a function going on in the hotel's ballroom until about midnight, featuring music so loud it could be heard inside our room.   The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and well maintained, staff was helpful. We ate only one meal in the restaurant, which was fine. Location is near the market and a short walk to the city center.

This buffet is free to hotel guests, but there is a reasonable charge for timeshare guests.       The grounds are beautiful and well maintained.

She was making charges that didn't correspond and missing another that did. I told her about the differences and she was hesitant to make the change even if money-wise it ended up being better for the hotel. I had to prove her she was wrong and then she went blaming other staff and the booking.com website instead of just accepting her error which was absolutely annoying.  Besides that everything was perfect :) and I'm happy to say so because we were celebrating our first anniversary with my wife and I wanted it to be perfect.

Cons:   The property seemed like a safe and secure location but stolen sandals by the pool on Apr 7th would concern me about the hotel being open to outside guests or staff 'eyeing' your stuff, I assume this might be a isolated insistent.

The lobby, main areas and pool are all very nice. I didn't have time to enjoy the pool area, but I saw it while at the AMAZING breakfast buffet. I had a room across the street from the main lobby. It was a huge room with a sitting area and fireplace. My only complaint about the room was that it was very warm. I opened the window for some fresh air, but since the room was on a busy street corner, I couldn't sleep with the window open. No A/C in the room I had, so it was quite warm. I do like the room cooler at night for sleeping, so this was a little bit of an annoyance, but not really a major concern. I think my room was #429.

It is wonderfully clean and the service is great, but the rooms are small and if you are downstairs they are very dark as well. There is a major road behind the hotel and the noise of trucks and cars plus their vibrations are annoying. There is no breakfast included so one should consider that the cost is actually $10 more a night if you include eating breakfast. I wish we had stayed at the Aura hotel as it is lovely, has a much better location and is much more value for the money. Casa Florencia is a long way from the center of town and most restaurants.

It appears that Camino Real management deliberately blocks mobile device reception within the hotel, just to access what is available at no cost throughout Antigua. The second insult came with the notice on each bottle of water that there is a $2.50 charge. Considering that the cost of a cold beer', 'Looks good.  Staff is not friendly and everything is extra - WiFi $10/day/device, room water $2.50, room coffee extra, breakfast is set menu with no changes, a second orange juice is extra.

We slept really well there!\", \"A friend and I were originally staying at another hostel that wasn't so clean, and smelled terribly of mold and sewage. Not to mention our sheets looked like they had blood stains on them and it was FREEZING, so we went or in search of a new hostel. Someone recommended the yellow house to us, so we came in and we were greeted by the lovely owner who offered us a tour. The whole place smelled so clean. There were women cleaning, and when we saw all the rooms we fell in love. When you're in a new country, one of the things you dread is smelling somewhere that's dirty. The yellow house is a great hostel and I would definitely stay here again.\", 'I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past 10 years, my most recent visit in September, 2007.  I trade in through a time-share (either RCI or II), and usually get the larger 1 bedroom villas which are located off to the side of the property.  The villas are furnished in a more \"colonial\" style, but the carpet is old.  I did, however notice that a lot of the rooms were getting new sofas during my last stay.  I believed that the hotel rooms are tiled, and not carpeted.   The service and friendliness of the staff has deterioted significantly since the hotel changed ownership (it used to be a Radisson, and now is part of the Soleil group).

This resort used to be the Four Seasons and was the best hotel in Antigua in the early 90s. It is too old to feel new, but it is not old enough to have any colonial appeal like some of the other hotels here do. The rooms were ok, they were always kept clean and we didn\\'t find any bed bugs. When we checked in they asked us if we wanted to the the \"All inclusive\" deal but we chose not to because we wanted to take advantage of all the great places to eat in Antigua. We did eat a few meals at the resort\\'s restaurant, and the food was terrible even though the service was excellent.

I especially loved the spa! Their prices were extremely reasonable for massage and their eucalyptus steam (with real dried eucalyptus) was marvelous!! My husband had a bit of a cold so this helped his sinuses extremely.  The breakfast buffet was fabulous and the service as well. They could use a better store for buying things that you may have run out of, but over all it was a great experience and I would go back just for the spa!  Our room was very nice and we loved the fireplace. The guy brought us wood every evening at no extra charge. Yes, it is a little far from the actual town, but with all the great food and eateries to be had in this', 'Well I stayed in the Hotel Villa Antigua around November 2005. We were a group of 21 friends. The hotel had very nice service, it took a while to check in, but its understandable since we were checking into 8 rooms. It was a little far off from the city, but as a group we enjoyed the walk and touring around Antigua. ( Just for you to know we were about 18 years old.)   Let me tip you on something real quick. In all Guatemala there is a law that I think all bars and clubs have to be closed by one. so that was kind of a bum for us. Although they tld us to go to a house party, we were later told that it could be dangerous. ( I also suggest take a cab at night back to the hotel DO NOT WALK, we were told they had mugged a lot of people there. SO BE CAREFUL! So we decided to go back', \"This hotel is ok, but for the price it is not worth it. The grounds are big and nice, but the rooms are not very nice. The carpet is very old and stained. The location is a little too far from the center of the city. You can find much nicer hotels for the same price closer to the center. The customer service was very bad. We had lost a book on our bus over and they didn't help us at all to contact anyone. They seemed to really not care much. We also had a problem with the shuttle. We called the morning of and they told us 12:05. Only they told us the wrong time and when we missed it, they said it wasn't their problem. We had to pay for a transfer by ourselves, even though it was part of our package.  Anyway, the hotel is ok, but really not worth the cash or bad service. \", 'The Porta Hotel is just two blocks from the main plaza.

They told me internet wifi was in addition, and at a cost of $10.00 PER DAY!  So I asked them if I could get access to internet in the lobby and was told it would be cost of $10.00 to me for 1 day.

Parking facility is ideal and convenient.    Everything about this hotel was excellent, except when it came to using WiFi.  There is a $10 charge for everyday you want to access the WiFi., and to add insult to injury, you have to pay additional amounts if you want to connect your phone and your iPad.

We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant one night, and everyone was pleased with their meals (I had the lemon chicken, which was tasty). They were one of the few restaurants with a children's menu, which was a nice change for our kids. The playground is awesome, and the kids loved looking at the birds.

Room was a little on the dark side as it faces inwards to an inner courtyard but this is a minor concern and typical of this traditional style of hotel.  Lovely courtyard garden and local decoration.  Loads of wardrobe and storage space for clothes etc. Cleaned daily with fresh towels and pillow cases which was a surprise. Apparently rooms on the second level are brighter.  Gets very busy at weekends so book ahead if wanting to stay on a Friday or a Saturday night. During the rainy', 'Very quiet and peaceful.  Upscale and very well mannered, friendly staff.  We had issues with air conditioning....try as they might, it could not be repaired.  But, we loved our room soooo much that we did not want to switch.  They gave us a floor fan which helped considerably and included breakfast. Upgrade to the deluxe room and ask for Room 102 specifically if you can...it is a dream room!  Private balcony and amazing space, including the shower for two which we dubbed \"the car wash\" because of all of the water jets!   I was working, so greatly appreciated the desk and extra space in the room. Downside....breakfast that is included is meager--anything off the little menu they give you is extra but it is enough to sustain! Don\\'t expect a buffet as you would get at many 5 star', \"the facilities are great, after all it is a 5 star hotel, but the fact that you are paying +$150 per night and does not include internet nor good communication inside the hotel is really disappointing. I had to go outside the hotel if I wanted to receive or make a call!!  you get charged $10 if you want internet for one device only! Just one!, I've stayed in 2 and 3 star hotels and they include internet!, and the food, not worthy of a so called 5 star hotel.  Pretty disappointing experience. I'll never go back.\", \"This is a very well run and clean hostel. Fantastic huge free breakfast! The only thing i'd fault was the location - it was a little further out from the centre of town than I would have liked. Other than that a great option for backpackers.\", \"This was a great hotel. The food was really good and we had a good time overall. The rooms are decorated very nicely and the grounds are well kept. It has a great location, only 3 blocks away from central park and it's very family friendly. It has a really nice playground for the kids and a cool little pool that is joined to the main adult pool making it seem as if it's one pool. The staff helped me coordinate a beautiful surprise for my girlfriend with rose pedals and a fruit platter.  The only negative part is that they get a lot of tour groups, conventions and they offer buffets with a pool pass to the public. This makes the hotel very busy and not a peaceful oasis as it could be. Even though it is busy the service never suffers.  At the very end of our stay we did come down\", \"The hotel is beautiful and covers a large plot. We had a conference here as well as staying here. It was fab. I had some issues with noise from my room neighbours and the hotel handled it really efficiently. The highlights of the hotel for me were the gardens, the parrots, the breakfast, the staff. I'd stay again.\", 'We stayed at this hotel as part of a Caravan tour. Many of us found our rooms stiflingly hot because the ceiling fan does not do enough to cool these rooms down. Perhaps other reviewers were there during cooler weather.  The only way one could get the room cool would been to have the inward-opening windows open, which would be dangerous in terms of security and insect bites. We thought the newer part of the hotel might have been that closer to the dining area since these dark, hot rooms did not provide the comfort to which others allude. The hotel is well-situated and the service is pretty good for Central America. However, if I were booking this trip on my own, I would be looking for a hotel with AC.', 'We stayed at the Hotel Antigua during Semana Santa.  The service was great, fun activities for kids, beautiful setting and convenient location.  Standard rooms had wood floors, high ceilings, fireplace, and a decent bathroom. But both beds had really uncomfortable, sagging mattresses -- avoid Room 108!', 'I must say I was quite impressed by the quality of the hotel.  Breakfast was definitely better then some other hotel I heard from.  I thought at first it was located far from central park but not all. You can easily get there in 8 minutes.   The room were very well cleaned and a bottle of water was provided everyday. The front desk was very helpfull and friendly. If I go back to Antigua, I will definitely go back to this hotel.', 'Casa Florencia is a really pretty, really CLEAN place -- but we did have a few problems. The rooms on the second floor are great -- lovely views and an attractive decor, but the rooms on the first floor have no view whatsoever and are sort of claustrophobic. Plus, there is a big noise problem -- you will absolutely hear anybody in the whole place getting up, there are a lot of roosters for neighbors, and the Guatemalan love affair with firecrackers will be obvious both late at night and first thing in the morning.  A few minor flaws: there was no shelf at all in the bathroom, and the large shutter windows open to a great view, (on the second floor) but when closed at night for privacy & insect protection, the room gets really stuffy. A fan and a shelf would solve both problems', \"I'd recommend if at anytime you're going to stay in Antigua you stay at the Camino Real.

It'll be the best you've had. And if not please do share where else may be better.  The grounds are very nice as are the room decorations. A tropical theme. My main complaint is that they are not an affiliate with a rewards program such as SPG. That and the cellphone reception in the rooms are nonexistent and they charge for breakfast and wifi. Also, when I went to use the jacuzzi and the jets weren't working I literally called 5 times within what nearly took an hour to have someone turn it on.

We didn't have time to go to the spa or pool, but they looked beautiful.  I hope to return.  We were only there for the night and didn't even get to eat in the restaurant, although it looked good.\", \"Hotel has very nice staff, but so-so accommodation for the price.  Our room was on the first floor, which means the windows face the walkway within the hotel, so you can't open the windows unless you want everyone to see you.  This means the room gets pretty stuffy at night.  Also, The rooms are very dungeon-like, sort of like a secret room in a castle.  Some people may like this, but we found it to be dark and old-fashioned. Because there was no natural light coming into the room, we were in there as little as possible.  Maybe the 2nd floor is better, but we would definitely try a different hotel next time I'm in Antigua for this price.\", 'I stayed at Casa Florencia for three nights.  It was an ok place.  Once you enter the hotel is it beautifully decorated.  The rooms were ok.  They were very clean but a little on the small side.  The bed was small for a double.  The room had a small tv with cable.   One of the things i did not like was that the room got a little stuffy at night.  The room we stayed in did not have AC nor a ceiling fan. Since the window did not have a screen we did not want to open it because there were several mosquitos that would enter.  I think the hotel can imporve that aspect.   The location of the hotel was also ok.  It was a little farther from the center of the town than we would have wanted, but definitely within a 10 min.  walking distance.

A beautiful small central courtyard with some chairs and tables and you could purchase a soda, beer or water to sit and read.  The room was spotless with tile floor and nice linens.  The bath was all tile and had very hot water and great pressure.  There was a tv with cable if  you like that sort of thing and a safe.  In addition they gave you free internet.

My sister got married at the hotel and had the reception there as well.  I enjoyed my stay very much there. The rooms were clean and spacious.  I shared a double deluxe room.  The beds were relatively comfortable. The room was near the end of the complex so in the mornings I could hear some traffic noise.  It didn't keep me up but it was audible.  The staff was accommodating.  They were polite & courteous.  I speak Spanish so it was easy to communicate although I think their English was just as strong.  I felt safe while staying there.

It's hard to find a place in Antigua that has all the little nice ammenities (hot water, cable tv, nice beds, tranquility) at a reasonable price in Antigua.  We payed $45 for two people in July of 2008 and it was well worth it.  The hotel is everything that the former reviewers have said it is.  Quaint, quiet, clean, comfortable.  A real gem in Antigua.  The only downside is that is pretty far from the central square, so if you want to be centrally located, this isn't the best option.  Of course, hotels near the center of town are more noisy.

The hotel itself is quiet and unassuming. Inside a lovely outdoor balcony looks out toward the volcano. In the early morning sunlight, it's a pleaure to sit and just stare across the terra cotta rooftops feeling Antigua awaken.  The floors, beds, bathrooms and common areas were all very clean.

They said they had my bag but I was already leaving the country and that I could pick the bag whenever I could go or authorize somebody. How couldI travel 2000 miles again and spend another $500?? Fortunately, I had friend living in Guatemala who could pick it up. Nevertheless, when my friend went to the hotel they made her wait a lot of time with no response. Now nobody answers since March and they haven´t said a word. My bag seemed to be neglected by the hotel.

Clean high sheet count white linens and down comforters with duvet.       The hotel takes up an entire city block, with all the rooms surrounding one big grass covered courtyard with pool (no jacuzzi). Pet Parrots that are out all day add to the ambiance of the hotel. The hotel seemed to be a hot spot for American retiree large group trips. This may or may not be comforting to you, but I found it so.

They helped confirm reservations in Spanish for me and were knowledgeable about the area. They also kept the place spotless! It has a very nice ambience... fresh floral arrangements, sitting benches to relax, hearty and delicious breakfast included, and comfortable rooms. The only thing that they weren't able to accomodate were additional towels. They weren't willing to give more than one towel per person (the towels are kind of thin) and did not provide washcloths.

The Yellow House serves up a mean breakfast - fresh fruit, eggs, pancakes.....and lots of it.  Best of all, there are some comfy chairs to lounge around in and chairs and tables to sit and do Spanish homework.  A great spot.....only drawback is no rooms with private bathrooms.  We looked at half a dozen hostals and the Yellow House was the best by far....for the money.  Highly recommended.', 'The hotel was lovely and quiet, set back from the road. The rooms were gated,  because you had to use your room swipe key to access the courtyards, which is great for security. Inside the rooms the beds were like marshmallows, all soft and inviting, the bathrooms were nice and clean. The downside to the hotel, the breakfast on the second day of the stay had no bacon (they had run out) ,the service was lacking, if you asked for tea/coffee you had to remind them as they walked past you for the third or fourth time.

I found this hotel to be very comfortable for our 'longer' stay as the internal surroundings are pleasant, BUT my overall comfort was 'disturbed' by the relentless reminders that, save for the room-associated amenities and breakfast, anything else cost extra - and the prices for them were not at all reasonable either !

The beds are extremely comfortable. We enjoyed active days in the area around Antigua and peaceful evenings in the hotel. An added bonus--the water in the taps is potable.   The weekend breakfast buffet was superb. The breakfast during the weekday mornings was adequate and similar to that from a mid-grade US hotel.  We had one evening meal at the hotel and found it minimally adequate also.

The hotel is absolutely gorgeous! Spanish style and very tastefully rustic. The rooms were fully accommodating and had a fireplace that could have been started by hotel staff. The hotel recently opened a spa. The spa was great with free access to the steam sauna and dry sauna. They also had free access to the spa showers that were over-sized with big rain shower heads. I enjoyed a long, hot shower in the spa after a long day of walking Antigua. I also received a deep tissue massage from the spa and it was fantastic.

The Porta Hotel Antigua, then, has done the impossible, by putting a property of over 100 rooms, noteworthy meeting facilities, a lovely central pool area, and lush gardens behind historic row houses, within old courtyards, and spanning across several blocks (there is even a tunnel between wings).

There was hardly any hot water in the shower the first night, but this was fixed the next day.  Positive: clean, nice little wardrobe, and nice interior.  Negative: very firm bed, nowhere to hang towels, small or big ones! (We had to use bathroom door and door knob).

Rooms are simple but clean and a great deal for travelers not looking for thrills, but desiring a clean welcoming space to rest.   In hind sight, we probably would've stayed at least one night in one of the larger luxurious hotels, but I'm confident we picked the right place for our low key sight-seeing vacation.

Our room was to have wifi included throughout our stay but everyday we had to call the front desk to have it turned back on and when we checked out they charged us for it. The maids and mini bar attendant don't bother reading the do not disturb sign posted on the door and just walk in.

The attention paid to every single detail - from the room decor to the hotel layout - was impressive.  The property was immaculate and the staff exceptionally friendly.  It was an excellent combination of modern meeting colonial.   Additionally, the hot tub was huge - as big as small pool.  Our room was well maintained:  the bed was quite comfortable, the bathroom was updated, the flat screen TV had ample channels.  And as an added benefit, there is a bakery around the corner, and in the afternoon, you can smell the fresh bread in the oven.

When my plate came, I was astounded.  The mussels were huge by my UK and south New Jersey standards.  Clam size and not tiny clams.  They were artistically  arranged and the presentation was very pretty.  But the mussels were really daunting.  Well - we were in a fancy place, so they were bound to be delicious, right?

It has beautiful grounds, carefully manicured. It feels like a very fancy Hyatt resort from the United States. But therein lies the problem, at least for me. You enter a cloistered world and don't really feel like you are in Antigua. Having said that, I suspect that many of the guests feel it is an ideal choice: teams of American medical volunteers and missionaries were there, chowing down on buffet breakfasts that are rather elaborate (and expensive) by Guatemalan standards before they set off for the day to do their good deeds.

This image is that of a “a first class experience in a luxury hotel that offers comfort and elegance in the middle of a legendary city”.

Further, they told us the internet was per device (though they finally conceded on this issue and gave us an additional password). Breakfast not included. The in room coffee even comes with a charge. When you do the math, you should really factor in at least another $50/day. The minibar was expensive. At least in the US, your typical 4 star hotel includes many of these things for free. Other complaint: the hot tub was only really hot the first day, and then it cooled down to the temperature of', 'I stayed at this hotel, as part of a large multinational group.The hotel consists of rooms in a hacienda style interspersed between small gardens and water features.The facilities are excellent with lovely large rooms and bathrooms with high ceilings.  The food is very good - well presented and a wide variety at decent prices. My colleagues were very impressed with the breakfast menu. The service was impeccable, and the staff really did try to accommodate the guests. My only grouse was the $ 10 USD charge for internet, and the room charges for tea, water and coffee in the room.

What a surprise we got when we arrived from Guatemala City at 10 pm, after having called at 8 pm from the airport and being told the room was waiting, to find no room booked for us. I had written to Vivian, the manager, about 10 emails, answering her strange questions where we were from, etc. as if my country of origin could determine the room availability. After about 10th email I managed to convince her that we really needed a reservation and finally about 4 days before our trip she confirmed it. It was all a joke, there was no room for us and not a trace of confirmation except for the emails, which had no value to the front desk person.

What sets the yellow house apart is a terraced common area with well kept greenery, four bathrooms with two having huge showers that are NEW and a large - yes - large breakfast which is included in the 75Q per night cost. We took a double room on the terrace in the back and had no issue with noise. The one small issue that may mean something to some people is that the shared kitchen is quite small and not much room in the fridge as they keep the breakfast food in it.

Failure to respond to emails about activities directed at concierge, eg email sent about local golf was ignored.  2. Moreover this hotel has a policy of charging for wifi per device which I have never seen anywhere.  I resent paying for wifi in a hotel period, but paying for each device is a bad joke.  I would call the hotel in advance before booking to get this changed for your stay or look elsewhere....this really is a terrible policy!', \"I chose to spend my birthday at this hotel. It is a BEAUTIFUL hotel. Walking around is gorgeous - beautiful landscaping, decorating, furnishings. The bed is maybe the most comfortable I've ever stayed in ever - like a giant pillow, with a great blanket. The bathroom is modern and comfortable, and mine had a beautiful cupula-skylight. The location was also very good, within walking distance of all of Antigua (though that's fairly standard for such a small town). The staff were also very friendly and eager to help - the bellhops a bit more than the front desk.

Those things were the only things that threw me off about the hotel. It's about the little things.. Also I wish they had a pool. They say they have one, but it's just an oversized jacuzzi.

Breakfast is great and food at the restaurant is really worth trying it. Rooms large and with all the commodities you expect.', 'The hotel is obviously new with its well-kept premises. The lobby is cozy and inviting with its classic motif which compliments the Spanish colonial architecture of the entire property. Instead of the usual multi-level buildings, the rooms are spread out along charming courtyards which makes the experience of staying here more unique. I would say the location is just fine at about 4 short blocks away from the Plaza Mayor.  The place is spotless. We stayed for almost a week and we could see that they put an effort to maintain the cleanliness especially in the rooms. We always had a good sleep with the comfortable mattress and pillows.

Further, there are other charges that I have not authorized. When I checked my family in for two nights, I payed about $260, but the receptionist was originally charging over $420. This is simply unacceptable. As a result, I have shut down my credit card. This was supposed to be vacation and has turned into a mess because the reception area didn't have trained people.   Please don't stay here, unless you don't care about your money. Another thing is that if you want to use the pool or gym, you will have to pay extra.\", \"Last week I stayed at the Camino Real in Antigua, and must say that the hotel is fantastic. The Suite I stayed in was very luxurious and gorgeous. The staff on property is very professional, and attentive making sure I had a memorable stay. One little disappointment is that everything in the hotel is very expensive. They charge you US$2.5 for a small bottle of water plus tax, and you also have to pay in order to access the internet. I've travelled a lot in Central America, and believe that they should consider to offer complimentary water and internet to their guests.

The less good things: I got about 90 seconds of hot water for 2 out of 3 showers. There was neither a/c nor a fan.  Merely irritating things: the front door is locked, so every time you come back to the hotel, you have to knock and hope someone heard you. Also, it's a little ways from the central part of town, but it's a small town, so that's only about 10-15 minutes of walking.\",\n 'We were in the room in front of the entrance, which has a very squeaky gate (a drop of oil would sort the problem in two seconds) so we could hear everyone who came in or went out; also people tended to stop in front of the room to talk and they could look inside through the windows. If you closed the shutters however, the room was very dark. Maybe the rooms upstairs are better. The bed sheets were old and looked worn and they did not fit the double mattresses. Also the pillows were pretty horrendous. The towels were a bit threadbare. On the plus side, the shower was good with very hot water and the room was clean.  It could be a decent place but it needs looking after. It is certainly overpriced.',\n \"This place is a dump.  there is no hot water here during the day.  In the evenings yes, but not during the day.  the shower was disgusting.  don't waste your money here.  For less money you can stay at a hotstel and have hot water.\",\n \"This hotel was terrible in every measureable way. Throughout our entire stay we were the only people in this hotel. We ordered a private room but the door didnt lock properly so we had to take nearly everything with us when we went out. The shower was extremely cold and did'nt lock either- this was a big issue as we were travelling with a girl and someone had to sit outside while she was showering  Overall, i would recommend to stay as far away as you can from this hotel, it will ruin your visit to this beautiful town\",\n 'Ended up here after a long search through Antigua for an affordable hotel. For some reason prices were extremely high at other places because of the weekend.. We were welcomed by a friendly young woman who showed us the room. Had a private room with a nice bed on the first floor at the front of the building. The shower was actually one of the best we have had, good amount of water and warm (hot!). We also had breakfast which was Tipico Guatemala and really nice. So if you are looking for an adorable place with a nice spacious room, go for it! On the map it looks way out of the city centre but actually it is only a 5-10min walk.',\n 'Very friendly staff! Room amenities were ok, but nothing special! Very close to town centre! We were unlucky that one of the apartments (no.6) next to us was owned by an American who really liked the sound of his own voice and liked to drink a lot! He made our stay very unpleasant!',\n \"No Tv, no fan, rooms with 2 beds,  small shower private bath room. No breakfast.  High speed Internet. Hot water. Spanish only.

Location was good on a fairly busy but not too loud street. Basic amenities.  No AC and hot water was not working. Clean and safe place. Nice little courtyard. No hairdryer. Overall a decent place if you’re not too picky. ',\n \"As a former resident of Antigua there are lots of hotels like this one.  Like others have said in the reviews, the rooms are super clean, the bathrooms are nice, they have flat screen tv's in every room and it truly is a cute little hotel.  What is exceptional is how nice, kind, and super friendly the owner and his son are.  Thats what makes this review a little difficult for me.  I so want to love this hotel and support this hotel and the owners but there are 2 things that you will likely struggle with if you stay here.  1. Its kinda noisey.  Yes, they have parking inside....literally inside.  We were in bed and asleep at 10:00 pm and awaken to the sound of a car backing into the downstairs court yard and they noise was loud enough to sound like we were sleeping in the garage. \",\n 'very nice stay, nice corner garden room, with confortable beds. bathroom a little small but confortable, need more space in the bassin may be  Delicious breakfast at the hotel as well as the bar ,i had some sándwiches to remember... very nice attention, i would really recommend your stay in Porta Antigua',\n \"Great setting, very relaxing and good location about 5-10 min walk from the main square. Lots of really positive stuff about the resort - gym is good, pool area is great for kids as is the playground. Deluxe garden room was recently renovated and very smart. Dinner at the restaurant was very good. Most of the staff were also lovely and very friendly and helpful. Relaxed vibe.  The negative stuff - mainly hinged around our reception experiences to be honest. We arrived at 830pm, one guy on reception and a large wedding party taking place so probably a bit stressed. However, he wasn't very welcoming, was quite dismissive and just wanted to get me to sign various paperwork, give us the key and send us on our way.

There is a place to park nearby 50Q for overnight so not the cheapest place but often worth it.',\n 'Great place to stay overall. The room was spacious and clean. The staff was also very friendly and helpful. It has a nice patio and balcony where you can relax. And if you walk a minute you are right in the hart of Antigua. I would 100% recommend this place.',\n 'The staff at Hotel Posada Santa Teresita is  friendly and helpful. The owner is lovable. The room was simple but nice. Location very good, but a bit away from Plaza Mayor. Good value for money. Generally, I  recommend this place.',\n 'The hotel is very clean, seems new, and is in good working order. The customer service is impecable and breakfast was very good.  As far as the negatives, parking was a nightmare, since they do not have own parking and we were sent to a sketchy place. The parking attendant seemed confused as to which hotel we were coming from, and he did not tell us that other cars would be blocking our exit. It ended up working out well. Also, bathrooms are very small, as there is no place to put down your toiletries bag. Finally, the street the hotel is on does have heavy traffic at times (I was there on a weekend).',\n \"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Hotel is lovely, rooms are comfortable with modern bathrooms. It's slightly further away from the centre of town, so while this is ok during the day, it may make some people feel slightly unsafe walking there late at night, as the streets are not well lit. We had no problems though. Breakfast here was fantastic - freshly made to order and huge servings. The only thing we would say is that the service isn't fantastic. Since it is a small hotel, quite a lot of the time there is only one staff member available, and sometimes this person did not speak English. We had a few times where we had some questions and couldn't really get assistance from the hotel. But we still enjoyed our stay here, as this didn't bother us too much.\",\n \"The room has a view on the main street of Antigua. The location is very central and there is a very small balcony that allowed us to see the busy street from the second floor. The rooms have Wi-fi, TV and a safe. There's no problem with hot water in the shower.  The breakfast is served every morning on a roof terrasse that is beautifully decorated and where you can also hang out throughout the day to read or browse internet. The woman serving breakfast is super nice and the breakfast are delicious: there is a choice of main meal and there is a food display of: coffee or tea, fresh water, bread, cereals, fresh fruits and cheese. Fresh orange juice was also part of the breakfast.  Only negatives: I think you pay more just because the location is on the main street. Also there is\",\n 'Nice hotel in central location.  As a word of warning despite what is advertised on their website, trip advisor and booking.com this venue does NOT have a 24 hour reception.

To their credit the hotel management team did go the extra mile to help try and recover the bag the next day.',\n 'We stayed for 3 nights. Room was clean and we had enough space.

We showed up to the hotel and the receptionist lady turned us away. She told us she didn't have a room available. But she said she had a small room, a very small room. She would have to put in an extra bed and it would be tight. She told us to look for other accommodations.  We asked her to cancel our reservation and to not charge our card and she said she would cancel it. We stayed the night at another hotel, but our card still got charged. So, we went back and asked to get our money back because we didn't stay there. We couldn't get a refund. The night before our supposed reservation we came into the office to make sure our card wasn't charged. We did what we could to cancel but the lady\",\n 'This hotel is beautiful.

Plus there is an amazing Gelato place next door.   I stayed in room 9 on the 2nd floor, away from the Lava Club. It is way too loud. I had to wear earplugs and download a white noise app on my phone. I do have insomnia so this is part of the problem. The other issue is there seems to be very thin walls between my room and the room next to mine, so I became intimately acquainted with the people in the room next to mine, and could hear them using the bathroom at all hours of the night.

The location is excellent, two blocks away from the Central Park and the rooftop view is beautiful. Breakfast was provided each morning which was good. Being from Canada, it was a little bit pricey because of the exchange but they have no control over that. Don’t forget to include the 22% tax on the posted rate which we forgot about. However, our room had no curtain in the bathroom so we were unable to leave the window open while we were showering which resulted in the room being very humid and steamy. Additionally the roll up blind in the bedroom was broken which reduced the amount of fresh air coming into the room. These are easy fixes which hopefully they will take care of upon reading this review. Would I stay here',\n 'Stayed here for 3 nights. I am aware of very high ratings of this hotel. I agree with some points mentioned, it was very clean, very good service as they booked my transportation very fast and efficient. However room #9 was very small, no where to put my stuff, no closet. Fast internet. But very small TV with no english channels. No refrigerator in the room, and no safe, so I had to visit the city taking the passport and money with me. Privacy was also in question. Either I had to shut down the windows with no light, or anyone passing by would see what I was doing in the room. ',\n 'The bed was comfortable but was a bit short.

We arrived in a tourist shuttle from Copan, Honduras at around 6 pm on New Year's eve.   As soon as we mentioned our hotel name to the driver, the  couple in front told us that they had booked that hotel 3 days prior using booking.com and this was not honored. We thought that this was just one bad incident. Wrong!  The manager just refused to look at the booking.com printout and told us no room. This is normally not a problem but this was New Year's Eve and we knew that hotels tend to be full at this time.

We had a junior suite on the second floor (9). It is clean and has a fantastic view of Volcan de Fuego. The room was great apart from a soft bed.   Breakfast was ok, and parking is not on site but 2.5 blocks away wasn't so inconvenient. You can walk to the central square in 10-15 min. It was shaping up to be a nice deal for Antigua at $105 per night. We would have overlooked the fact that there was no hot water on the first day and constant clanging of bells from the nearby church from 5:30 am if that had been the only complaint.   Unfortunately, the second night, there was a loud bar playing music\",\n 'We had a large room for a family of four. The room is nicely decorated, though the bathroom is kind of small.

The staff was attentive and friendly. Our 18 month old enjoyed playing in the garden. We appreciated breakfast included in the daily price and the hotel was in walking distance to the central park. For the price compared to other places, we were satisfied with our stay. However, we had to close our windows because of the mosquitos and our room got pretty stuffy. Maybe they could have a few portable fans available. I have also stayed in places that have better showers. It was a sufficient short-term place to stay.

I stayed with a friend traveling to Antigua we were very happy on arrival. The next day we woke up to being covered in bed bugs. Which is not a way to spend your vacation. It was horrible.

This time, I tried the Santa Teresita. I pre-booked a Single Room online at a 68% discount. This brought the price down from US$33 / night to US$10.50 (or GTQ121 including the additional 22% taxes). This came with a free breakfast. The room was small but came with an ensuite with daily housekeeping, a hot shower and cable TV. A Breakfast is worth about GTQ25 ... so the room was excellent value at GTQ121 but IT IS NOT worth the Rack Rate of GTQ380 / night that it is listed for. It is worth about GTQ175 / night including Breakfast. The hosts were nice people and it had a comfy common area.

There is a kitchen you can use and the rooms are very clean.  The owners and staff were always available and very helpful.

It’s a great place from which to launch a walking circuit of all the sites in the city and is very close to a square where a (cooked) food market bustles at night. Plenty of tiendas for essentials like wine and snacks too.   As for the property, it is just lovely. Pass through a locked gate to a gorgeous small colonial courtyard with a small fountain.

It seems that many stay in the South West of Antigua where McDonald's and Subway were located, but I am glad that we stayed in the opposite side of the city, where it was quiet.

Breakfast (included) consists of 2 eggs, black beans, fried plantains, and 2 roles (and coffee or juice).  We had to leave early twice, so we had breakfast 3 times at its lovely dining area.

It was very clean and bright and one of the best equipped places we have ever stayed at.  This was a very important feature for us because my wife likes to cook a lot when we are away and normally the lack of good kitchen utensils limits what she can do but this was not the case here.  The location is great being within easy walking distance of the Parque Cenral and the great restaurants in the centre of Antigua.  Lesley and her staff were superb and responded very graciously to every request we made.  We will certainly stay here again on our next trip to beautiful Antigua',\n 'Once we arrived we were greeted at the closed gate by the 24 hour security guard.

Upstairs was the bathroom and bedroom with ample room. Our walk into town discovered a very small grocery store 1 block away for basic needs but a larger grocery store on the other side of the main town courtyard about 6 blocks away.

That said, like many hotels in Antigua, you don’t want to open your window to the street (most rooms) as the noise continues well into the night.

If you want a room to sleep and nothing more, it’s fine. The shared spaces were very nice, with a roof top balcony where we watched the fireworks at New Year which was amazing. The staff were very helpful and kind, although there was a mix up with our online payment that resulted in us taking out quetzales that we later didn’t need. We had a room with a double bed that was pushed against two walls and so was quite cramped, even for a couple. Our window was out onto what appeared to be a storage area for cleaning supplies, which meant we got to hear a lot of morning conversations from the housekeeping staff.  The hallways were pretty loud too. It seemed most rooms had no exterior windows at all so I’m glad we had our one',\n 'This hotel is operated by a group of women very close to the central plaza in Antigua. It is very clean and well staffed. The staff will make transportation shuttle arrangements to other parts of Guatemala. They were able to assist us with everything.',\n 'El hotel is advertised as HOTEL EURO MAYA SUITES, but the real name is HOTEL EURO MAYA. I select this hotel due to the nice reviews I was reading on TripAdvisor, my question is those reviews are real? Or people’s opinion on service are kind of crazy lol. Or my standards are too high. The hotel website and pictures are well done Photoshop because the REAL hotel are totally different form reality. I paid ($131.85 US Dollars for 2 night like $922.95 Quetzals) with breakfast included. Room are terrible poor clean and nasty towels really old and almost useless.  The location is far from the central square, so not convenience location as the reviews said. Love Antigua Guatemala, great UNESCO cultural site and many things to learn from the Colonial time in Central America.',\n 'With the price of Hotel Euro Maya being exceedingly inexpensive, one shouldn’t expect a 5-star hotel.  The hotel had good and bad points.  * Location: The hotel’s location is ideal--less than one block from Central Park, which the whole town revolves around.   * Staff: Extremely polite, helpful, accommodating, and friendly.  * Architecture: The hotel’s interior space is gorgeous, with a Spanish Colonial style, open-air courtyard and hallways.   * Rooms: The rooms are a little dreary; definitely less spectacular than the public areas.  They could use some fresh paint and less shabby furnishings.  The worst thing about the rooms are the truly awful travel posters dotting the walls.  The posters are cheap and in shoddy frames.  The place would instantly look so much better without',\n 'Euro Maya is a nice, small hotel, with a great location! The staff are friendly and helpful. The room was clean, and the breakfast was fine. Euro Maya has two things going for it: 1. The roof-top terrace. A great spot for breakfast and enjoying the volcano views! 2. It is 3/4 a block from the Central Park. If you are looking for a posh place that has top-of-the line sheets, towels and other services, this is not it. If you are looking for a clean, friendly, affordable place to lay your head, Euro Maya fits the bill! ',\n 'We booked with this hotel when we returned to Antigua mainly because it is mistakenly listed in Booking as a 4* hotel. Well here are some facts. THIS IS NOT A 4* HOTEL, its a travel agency that happens to rent some rooms. You could tell from property sign too. The location is superb but that\\'s all. The problem with the disgraceful service began before we even step our foot it the \"hotel\", as they charged my credit card (issued by european bank = got lousy exchange rate) without asking me while I wasnt there !!!!! We arrived before the supposed check in time and when I complained, they talked about some non-existent policy for which Booking.com was mentioning nothing.   The Front Desk employees (or whatever this supposed to be, probably the travel agency) could hardly speak',\n 'We enjoyed our stay at El Hotel Meson de Maria.   Everyone was incredibly professional and courteous,   Breakfast was delicious and a perfect way to start your day  The location was incredible, we walked everywhere.  El Meson de Maria is  at the center of everything!.    This hotel is very clean and  incredibly charming, and decorated just right for Antigua!   The only thing we would of liked was for our room to be a bit bigger, and the bathroom updated.      Having said that, we highly recommend for anyone to stay at this hotel.',\n \"We were in Antigua for a birthday celebration, we booked this hotel because we thought it was centrally located and the price was ok. The hotel is located in town not very central but accessible. They offer parking but it's 4 blocks away. The bad thing about this hotel is that it's located next to the Alliance française, the weekend that we stayed there they had a concert. We were ok until the bad concert lasted until 1 am. At 1 am I had to ask the watchman to call the police, be aware that at 6:00 pm the manager leaves, they close the door and there is nobody to assist you. Also across the street there is an establishment that I am not sure if it is a bar, restaurant or hotel. They had groups of noisy people coming and going all night long. We didn't sleep, it was horrible.\",\n 'We had casa noble booked as a second option as we needed to extend our stay by one night and our accommodation told us they were full. We saw the reviews on here so went to check the place out. We were pleasantly surprised to see a very pretty hotel set around a lovely garden. We had a look at a couple of rooms and they looked clean and comfortable. The owner was also very friendly and helpful. In the end our hotel had availability and pure lazyness stopped us from moving hotels for one night. I would, however without hesitation stay at this hotel if we were to come back to antigua.',\n 'Stayed one night as our first hotel was full on the last night of the stay. Place is in a sorry state of disrepair and looked very unloved. Rooms and general appearance are a bit shabby and we were the only ones in the hotel despite the entire town being full for a big event. Service was not obvious and the place seemed spooky, Luckily just for one night but in good conscience cannot recommend.',\n 'We stumbled onto Hotel Casa Antigua at the last minute, as we were changing our travel plans. It is made from two adjoining, renovated colonial houses with high ceilings, antique touches (including a pulley to open/shut a skylight in room #5), and beautiful gardens/courtyards. The beds were comfortable, and--importantly for our family--there were multiple rooms with options for 3-4 beds. It is two blocks away from the central square and minutes from many great shops and restaurants. Although in general the hotel feels quite secluded from city noise, there were some modest issues due to the configuration of rooms opening to the courtyard. At late afternoon (and briefly in the AM), there is a huge flock of birds roosting and causing a ruckus in some of the trees in the courtyard.',\n \"This is a centrally located hotel for people wanting a decent place to stay at a fair price in Antigua. We had two rooms and they were very different in size so worth asking for a spacious room when booking. The smaller room also smelt  very strongly of cleaning fluid but it did have a window and fan. The staff were warm and friendly. There was free water and tea/coffee on tap which we hadn't found in the more expensive hotels. My private bugbear is hotels charging you for bottled drinking water in small bottles so fair play to Casa Antigua which does not do this. There are lovely places to sit quietly and a shop selling local goods.\",\n 'I would concur with all the positives about this hotel, i.e., cleanliness, convenience of location, breakfast, etc. We did not meet the owner, but rather dealt with a young lady who was new to the area, so the fact that she spoke English, did not help us much in answering local questions. The other receptionist did not speak English. She was on duty when we checked out so I was unable to resolve the $100 overcharge on our bill until I returned home. It was eventually resolved with a series of emails. If it weren’t for this uniquely negative experience, I would return to this hotel and recommend it to others. However, with so many hotels, we decided to choose another when we returned at the end of our vacation. It was not nearly as nice and more expensive.',\n 'I stayed 4 nights at this cute little hotel. It’s located at an amazing spot in the very centre, a minute walk from the park. I stayed in room 15 which has a king size bed and a private balcony with a view on the street and a volcano. The property is well maintained, has a nice pool and inner garden. Good value for money! Next door is El Barrio a traditional complex with 5 different bars. Mind that if you stay in room 15 that you will hear some faint music till around midnight. After that it’s quiet. In the other rooms I guess you are fine. We didn’t mind it, at all, it even gave some charm, guess we are city people :)',\n 'The hotel and the rooms are nice. My wife and I got the Mountain View room and the only thing we didn’t like was the bathroom. It was really small and when flushing toilet the water pressure was super super slow.  Bathroom where toilet is was really small. Need to leave door open while using it.   Really important: if you like to party. There is a super cool bar next door that lots of people visit and socialize.  If you like to sleep early to get energize for your tours, this is not the best place to stay.   Noise ends up around 1:00am   Costumer service was really amazing.  We really enjoy their service from everyone.  ',\n 'This is a lovely hotel right off the main square. Has a pool, which is great. Right next door to a few bars so its nice to have that near if that interests you, but if you have issues with noise, request an interior room. Very nice staff.',\n 'Antigua already has a lot of personality, and this hotel continues that. Helpful staff, rooms with character, great views including volcanos, They were very helpful when my initial room was a challenge as I have a light disability. It was exchanged without fuss. The food was excellent including provision for allergies.',\n 'This hotel has great service, beautiful grounds, clean rooms and comfy beds. Loved the amenities and the location. I loved having filtered water in the room.   The hotel restaurant is lacking in vegetarian options on their menu... surprising given the focus on sustainability. One night I had an asian dish for dinner.',\n 'I stayed with my wife for two nights and it was very quite and comfortable. The price is good and cheap. The owner are very nice and welcoming. The place is clean and they have also a good kitchen. Free wi fi  The bilding is a bit old and not all the rooms are the same but ours was very nice',\n 'We stayed 3 nights. We appreciated the warm welcome of the staff and room was clean and perfectly matching with the description of the website.  Many advantages with this hotel: located in the city center (everything on walk can be done), agencies very closed, quiet, ect.... The hotel itself is very nice decorated and I personally I really enjoyed the terrace with the view on the volcano....really beautiful.   The only inconvenient was that other customer were a little bit behaving loudly during night...  Muchas gracias al personal del hotel por su amabilidad',\n \"I stayed 3 nights in this hotel and I could not sleep one night! The staff is friendly but unfortunately they don't do anything if you complain about the noise at 11 or 12 o'clock in the evening ... you can hear every noise and movement in the other rooms and outside, we were also unlucky to have clients in the hotel that did not care about other clients that want to sleep. Do not recommend this hotel if you want some peace and quiet.\",\n 'Although out of the central district of town, the property is lovely with a large garden.  Apparently we were lucky to get an interior room opening to the garden as we overheard from others that exterior room fronting the street was noisy. Room was quite large with a cool dome.  No heat or AC: presumably temp is usually moderate (although reading another review, seems they were too hot.  Going in Dec, the weather was chilly and we were on the cold side). Main drawback is the included breakfast is mediocre at best. Otherwise, staff friendly and helpful.  It is a bit of a hike over uneven cobbled road into town but easy to get taxi or tuk-tuk service at reasonable cost.',\n 'First the positives. The hotel looks great and the grounds are a credit to the team responsible. The location with the restaurant overlooking an active volcano was spectacular, imagine dinner with a backdrop of lava spouting from a volcano. Probably not a daily event, but we were lucky. The hotel should however be better, and lets itself down. The rooms are clean, of a good size but lack air con. You would therefore expect to be able to ventilate by opening the windows, but with no insect screens, this is just not sensible, resulting in a stuffy room. The rooms also have no room safes. Guests can place valuables in security boxes at reception, but with travellers carrying tablets, laptops, cameras, phones etc this is not suitable or practical. It is really not good enough not to',\n \"A very pleasant hotel on the outskirts of the colonial city of Antigua. Lovely gardens, friendly staff and a good restaurant.  Our room was clean and a good size. My only complaint would be that the room was very dark even with the lights on. We walked into the main part of town every day but stayed at the hotel at night to eat after our tour finished, mainly because it the streets weren't well lit and the cobbled roads and sidewalk was very uneven with lots of holes.\",\n 'A very pleasant and nice hotel with relatively large rooms, good food, and a very helpful service. The hotel is built as a colonial villa, spread around very nice gardens, and separate 2-floors small buildings, and a central building with a nicely viewed + balcony dining room.',\n \"We stayed here w/ our three little kids (8, 6, 4). Four blocks from the park and/or La Iglesia de San Francisco.  We stayed in the big suite w two beds.  We were thrilled to have a modest kitchen and hot water.  Okay, it  wasn't 400-year old adobe, but who cares when you have your own washer/dryer and stove?    Someone pointed out earlier that their slusing door wouldn't lock.  We found this to be true in our unit as well.  I ended up using the dustpan handle as a door lock, which worked alright.  I can understand her concern, as the unlocked door expised to the outside was unsettling.  Would we stay again?  Certainly.  Especially for an extended stay.\",\n 'I recently stayed in this hotel in Antigua, about 7 blocks from Central Park, beautiful, cozy two- story villas with washer, dryer, full kitchen, two beds + comfortable sofa bed.  Parking included right in front of the rooms. Would definitely recommend.',\n 'Lovely position and we had a nice room. Glad I was not on the courtyard though with people having breakfast right outside my bedroom window. What was so sad was the poor attitude of the front desk staff. Water was rationed with no attempt to offer filtered water. There was no tea service in the room. Morning tea was fine but any other was undrinkable as the manager either couldn’t or wouldn’t provide hot water. Maybe it was a lack of English but that is also not good enough for the front desk. By the way they charged for it! No effort made to resolve the problem. Plastic flower petals on towels ! Really! Don’t bother ! No turn down service so dirty towels and cups left all night. Not what I would call a “boutique” hotel. More a very average hotel with a label.',\n 'Do not stay here! We booked through booking.com and paid in cash when we checked out. About a month later we noticed that they had charged our Visa card as well. Both San Jeronimo and booking.com are refusing to refund us. They are so many better options in Antigua at a better price. STEER CLEAR!! ',\n 'This hostel provides a bed, at an average price.The location is rather decent; it is where you want to be in Antigua. There was rather a problem with the cold at night and quite a strong smell of disinfectant at times, which at least tells me that some cleaning occurs there. It has little in the way of a social atmosphere and certainly lacks any of kind of usefulness or warmth from the staff. They are neither friendly, nor knowledgeable about the town or transport there. More importantly, during my stay, I began to suffer from the Zika Virus. While the hostel was of no fault there, what was concerning to me was that I was in bed for several days, moaning and looking dreadful, while the staff walked past, unconcerned. I would value some social responsibility.',\n \"We have just arrived here after reserving in advance. The rooms are not as shown in pictures. There is no natural light, some don't even have windows. The place is dirty and smells of damp. The staff are insisting we pay the full amount and will not offer us use of the phone to call booking.com to try and resolve the problem. Terrible rooms and terrible customer service.\",\n 'Stayed three nights. Unfortunately the room is smaller than it appears in pictures, no natural light and very stuffy air. We had to keep the door open. A lot of noise from the staircase. Staff friendly enough but seem a bit over worked. We often had to wait some minutes to be let in at night after ringing the bell.   Place clean enough, decent location, decent shower. Pretty nice upstairs outside courtyard. There are places which offer better value for money elsewhere.',\n 'The receptionist provided us with little to no information as to the details of the hotel. We had to prompt every time. The room was clean but the walls are so thin that you can hear anyone who may be making some noise.  There is no air con or fan so when it is hot, it is very hot!  Breakfast was not included in our rate despite it saying it on our hotel room door and on our confirmation. When asking the staff about it, it wasnt really her problem so meh!  I would probably pay extra and stay elsewhere next time as Antigua is beautiful and deserves a better experience.',\n 'The rooms are a small box with no ventilation, no air circulation and not even a fan.  You get one tiny window with a \"courtyard\" view.  The shower only got to luke-warm, and they turn the water off periodically at night.   I will say that the staff was generally nice and they did their best to make our stay pleasant.  We had an evening flight, and the staff did let us keep our bags at the hotel after checkout.   This is NOT a luxury place.  It is in a decent location so if you just need a place to crash it might be ok for you.  We visited in December, so thankfully it was cold at night, I imagine it would be impossible to sleep if the temperature was hotter.',\n \"We booked at Monasterio because we got a very good deal through Expedia. I was a bit anxious about it since they only had one previous review. Now I'm glad we stayed here. It's very welcoming and the staff is great!

But.... no screens on windows - so mosquiro woke me in the night; onsite bar, across from our room was noisy while trying to sleep; no A/C or fan, so the room was hot; shower didn't turn off and dripped all night.  Will we stay here again - never.  \",\n \"Nice decoration and terrace but they overcharged us when they converted the USD price in a loca currency and they pushed us to consume the difference in the hotel!

The staff is very friendly and the lady at the front desk speaks fluent English. If you want luxury and spacious rooms - you will want a different hotel.  If you would like a nice, clean, quiet place to sleep ... its fantastic.  Plus you do get breakfast included in the rate. The hotel is a few blocks from the central park however, on the same street as the Santa Clara ruins, close to Hermano Pedro Church and many amenities.  The walk to central park is only 10 minutes maximum.  Which by the size of Antigua is very reasonable.  Many times we have walked around Antigua after dark.  It is a very safe place and there are a lot of police, tourist security and PMT (traffic police)',\n 'The room is very small, not very clean (dusty). The bed was very uncomfortable and there was hardly any hot water in the shower.',\n \"Casa Noble is very pretty and has really cute and spacious rooms. The staff is nice and the hotel is safe and quiet. The downside is that it's about a 10-15 minute walk from the central area...not a big deal during the day, but it's not recommended to do that walk at night. If you plan to have late evenings (after 10), I'd recommend staying a little closer to the central area (but not too close as it can be really loud, even late at night).\",\n 'We   booked    the    hotel   online   with  Expedia.

Here is the deal...it deserves 5 stars because of its potential and its abundant  character but will not get 5 stars because one has to sacrifice certain creature comforts like AC (it has fans) and older restrooms.

Excellent location.  I could not recommend this hotel night. Especially for larger parties that can book in advance several of their rooms. The courtyard is beautiful and quaint. ',\n 'The location is central, the price is very reasonable, the beds and decor are nice and comfortable.  My only complaint is that we did not have any hot water over the 3 nights we stayed at this property.  We complained about it on several occasions and the hotel tried to fix it (but only after the second complaint), and ultimately could not fix it.   Not a big issue given that it was pretty warm outside when we stayed, but want to point out the issue.',\n 'We definitely enjoyed our stay here. Authentic Antigua! For sure. Which means..very old structure/building, decent facilities, food. Super friendly workers. Reasonable, super-convenient Guatemala City airport pickup. Rooms are fine. Seem like refurbished horse stables..but that is selling it low. Awesome courtyards, and even awesome-er views of volcanos from the roof. Craft brewery/restaurant across the street. ',\n 'Early Check-In available.  The owner went with me though all the options and answered all my questions before I made my decision.  He ran me through the prices and the availability.   The Posada is within walking distance of a lot of the restaurants, bars, and the market of Antigua.   The staff working at both Posadas are really helpful, and will cater to your need were you to have any.   The people here are really warm, and for the price, I felt I got a great deal.',\n \"The rooms are really small, the lady at the front desk was really rude with me and my family. The only good think was the boy that stays at night in the front desk that was really nice, but for the rest we didn't enjoyed our time there. \",\n \"I Always came to Posada de San Jeronimo because the service was nice and the hotel was clean. These days the service changed alot and i didn't feel welcome. Prices changed as well since three months. Things don't make sence: a room for 4 people is 400 while a room for 2 people with private bathroom as well is 150, but that's their own choice.\",\n 'Room 204 has a terrible ant issue. I have found swarms going in a bottle of water which had no sugar. I find them everywhere I have had the housekeeper clean and bug spray the room to no avail. When I reported it, the responses instinctively sounded rehearsed/ automatic which made clear this was a pre-existing problem. The staff always did the best they can to resolve it. Once I had dinner indoors within minutes my takeaway box was swarmed with tiny ants. Pretty gross. Also when I checked in there was multiple blonde hairs in one of the bed. The other had stains. It was obvious beds were made but sheets were not cleaned. Blankets are just folded but smell like not cleaned in a long time. They should wash blankets per guest. I really love this place. The staff and cleaners are',\n 'We booked on trip advisor and we were not disappointed. Our room faced all three volcanos and had a perfect view. The staff were great. Only thing is, there is no restaurant, but many good ones very close by. (Room 302 is the best.) situated very close to parque centro, the market and of course pollo campero. Great breeze for afternoon nap. Locked gate and door at night. Coffee bar across the street Espeessart is great. Free cup of coffee if you buy a bag. Great place for semana Santa. ',\n \"This hotel wasn't the worst, but definitely wasn't top notch. For the entire week we were there, there was no hot water. The free WiFi was terrible and often cut out or there was such a weak signal. The bed was hard as a rock and when we asked for an extra pillow they said they didn't have any more. The walls are paper thin and you can hear your neighbors talk, sneeze, or use the restroom. There are other places in Antigua that are the same price with higher quality. The staff was always very friendly though.   I will not be staying here again \",\n \"A delightful colonial style villa with well kept gardens in this delightful city of Antigua, Guatemala. Unfortunately, it was a bit out of the city centre. The rooms were big and ventilated naturally with no AC or heating but that did not bother me. The bathroom was quite big, well-furnished and clean. Reception was very helpful and ready for me when I arrived. The restaurant was very good but the service was a little slow with hand-written bills. Breakfast was very good with eggs prepared on demand and conforming to one's choice.\",\n 'We have stayed here for 6 nights in room 71, our room is large as is the bathroom. Our bed is very firm & the room is dark but comfortable. There is no fridge, mini bar or kettle to make tea or coffee. The staff have been very friendly & helpful especially Victor who works in the restaurant who gives exceptional service. We have breakfast included in our stay, which has not been to my standard, but Victor has really been great at trying to please. The restaurant food is very average. Our room overlooks a beautiful garden that is well kept, the grounds & rooms are very clean. Our room has a 2nd story above & we can hear the people above walking around very early in the morning.',\n 'Beautifully laid out hotel 20 minutes easy walk from centre. Good warm pool with loungers. Pleasant bedrooms and decent sized bathroom. Friendly staff. The breakfasts however are terrible even the Sunday one which is bigger. The scrambled eggs are barely cooked and the refried beans are terrible. The fried plantain are greasy and the fresh fruit was mushy. The coffee was fine though.',\n 'Antigua overall is much lovelier than the city.  The service and food here was good. Unfortunately the wifi was pretty bad - my room (111) was a complete dead zone.  I could only use the wifi in the reception/dining area if I needed to use my phone/iPad. The view of the volcano is nice.  My room was clean, except the floor, and I was missing a washcloth. Be prepared for some noise while sleeping - someone near me was leaving early and his/her rolling bag on the cobblestones woke me up. No A/C or heat - I slept with the windows open (in February).',\n 'We really loved this hotel, the only slight downside being that the room was small with not much space for our things. BUT everything else made up for that. The quirky stepping stones over water to our room (no.6) was a great touch! The room was extremely well equipped with fridge, water each day, excellent & plentiful toiletries, coffee machine. The cosy little lounge has complementary hot drinks always available and if not hot enough, the super- friendly staff are always on hand to make more. The lovely Melvin and young woman whose name I didn’t get were especially helpful. Tiny garden with plunge pool & lovely roof terrace are great. Use of sister hotel Porta was a bonus too, and the location just 5 mins walk from the main square, shops & restaurants was quite perfect. Highly',\n 'This is a very cute and charming boutique hotel. Staff were very kind, professional and helpful. Perks about this hotel are that breakfast is included and you can use all the amenities of Porta Hotel just a block away.  We stayed one night with my daughter in the upper terrace room, but sadly had a rough night sleeping through because of all the noise from the streets below. This should have been notified to us beforehand, since receptionist agreed that it was very noisy room and this complaint was common. We were disappointed with the value of the room and the lack of rest.   Perhaps staying in another room on the bottom floor and further back would have been a more pleasant experience.',\n 'Stayed 2 nights in early April 2019. Property is impeccably well maintained and clean. Small hotel and facilities. Reasonably private and saw few other guests. Suite room was spacious but not particularly luxurious. Location was reasonably central, there is some noise from buses/trucks but by no means loud. However, I felt for the price there are many similar options in Antigua.',\n 'So the last night there we had a security guard try and come in assuming we were drunk or something and get in the room with 2 girls touching them inappropriately. He was asked to leave and he did for a few minutes but tried coming back with 3 additional guys to get in the room. They eventually gave up but such a horrible experience specially from the overnight guard.',\n \"We stayed here for 4 nights. Our room was basic and clean. Loved saying hi to the dogs on the way in and out. Great location. The kitchen upstairs was pretty basic - didn't end up using, but ask at front desk (we asked for wine opener and they had).\",\n \"Tasty coffee! Very pleasant and helpful staff. They help with the shuttles.  The location is great, easy to find, close to Cerro, 10min walk to the centre and in a quiet area. Don't worry, it's safe!  Actually there's no volcano view from the property, but it's the first thing you see when you go out. There's a small parking, I suppose it's free for guests. Warm shower only at low water pressure. Average breakfast (chapin, traditional).  If you want to take a shuttle you should know that it's more than probable that you'll be the first in the bus. Great, you can choose your seat... In return be prepared for 30min cobbled road ride to collect all the passengers from other hotels. If you are late, they'll probably come back in 30 mins ;)\",\n \"We moved here from a lovely but far less functional hotel.  The location is great, the rooms are comfortable and everything works as it should.  No problem with hot water.  The price is reasonable for Antigua--we find bang for the buck to be much higher generally in Mexico, but... you're in Antigua!  Breakfast was included and adequate.  Staff friendly and helpful...out of a gazillion hotels in Antigua this appears to be a reliable option, and we would return.  Cannot recommend the shuttle van their lobby travel agent booked us on to Lake Atitlan--they put 13 in an 8 person van, a hellish 3 hour ride with no potty break!  Ack!\",\n \"We were only there one night but thought it was great. The price was reasonable for a great location and a pretty nice hotel. It was quiet, the beds were comfortable, and everything was clean. Breakfast was included and was better than we'd expected. We'd definitely return and recommend the Euro Maya to others.\",\n \"Clean, cozy & comfortable. You DO have to tell them when you'd like hot water, about 10 minutes before you want it or give them a time and for me it was on. Very hot and lots of it. Our room had 2 double beds, tv with satellite, closet and large bathroom with shower/tub. Internet connenection was poor in our room, but just outside our door in the courtyard was perfect. The breakfast was available from 7am to 11am, was a little different each day. But had boxed cereal, fruit, rolls, jam, yogurt, your choice of eggs, home fries, one day pancakes, they had a travel agent at the desk & were knowledgable about the attractions & the area. Close to everything, restaurants & shops in every direction. Just a 2 to 5 minute walk to the Central Park. Guides also available in this park area,\",\n \"We arrived at this hotel after an early start and long travel to be told immediately that there was no room for us due to an overbooking. This was despite our room being reserved and paid for in full for at least 2 months previous. We were told that they were upgrading us to their other property the Euro Maya Suites where the rooms were nicer apparently, after a quick check online I found out that to stay at the Euro Maya Suites it was indeed a little bit more expensive. BUT the reason I booked the Euro Maya was more for the location and the rooftop terrace which the other one didn't have. The girl on reception was very nice to us and did give us a small discount on an excursion to the Pacaya Volcano, the room at the suites was a lovely room and we had a great time in Antigua\",\n 'We so much enjoyed staying here. Every corner of the small intimate hotel was gorgeously decorated, its staff courteous and helpful. Breakfast was at its delightful courtyard, and they provide free drinks/tea in the afternoon. They have a good size rooftop seating area with an amazing view of the surrounding active volcanoes. Memorable stay.',\n 'Very Good Hotel. The staff was amazing. They will do anything to make your stay wonderful. Good breakfast, the rooms are big and comfortable, and a very good value. The only draw back is that you can not get internet in your rooms due to the large walls, but you can get internet in the beautiful gardens.',\n \"Through luck of the draw, we ended up with a huge 2 room suite. The rooms were amazing and we loved it. Access to many of the attractions of Antiqua is excellent. The WiFi signal was weak and worked best in the courtyard.  But the courtyard is so beautiful you'll want to spend time there anyway.\",\n 'The staff at this hotel was very friendly and knowledgeable. We asked for a restaurant that was close by and \"economically priced\" (i.e. cheap) they recommended Rincon Tipico (was great btw). The room was cute and clean but the bathroom wasn\\'t so great. The shower stall and toilet are separate and the doors are flimsy. Taking a shower was difficult because the water kept leaking out.   I never saw or are at the breakfast buffet (as described). Didn\\'t know it existed. The staff refered us to a restaurant next door.   The pool is not heated as described, either.  Aside from that, the service waa great and the views are incredible. This hotel is located near the square and very convenient for sightseeing.',\n 'This small hotel is right around the corner from the main square.  The staff were great!   They helped me line up transportation, were kind, and even knocked on my door at 330am to make sure I was awake!!! Service and lovely!!! ',\n 'I spent one night here and would have liked to have stayed longer if possible. I arrived late at night, with a prearranged airport pickup through the hotel. The taxi was there to meet me and check in was smooth even late at night. My room was really charming and clean. Breakfast the next morning was fantastic. Recommended!',\n 'A lovely, well-situated, budget to mid-range hotel. Pleasant staff, good housekeeping, basic room and a comfortable bed. A few steps from the main square. Central breakfast patio lends itself to interaction amongst guests. No complaints. Enjoyed our stay and we have booked for our return to Antigua in a few days time.',\n 'It is always a good  experience.we have been there already 3 times and we will continue visiting Antigua  Guatemala.Porta hotel is one of our favorites,the pool is amazing perhaps could use a little more heating for  the time of the year.The food is also great and the people who work there are very nice.',\n 'We stayed here 4 nights as a last minute change. We had booked to stay at Hotel Antigua but apparently there was an issue with our room, and no others available, so they moved us here. We were in a nice spacious Triple room (1 double, and 2 singles) with a fan (no ac) but it was cool in the evenings so a fan was adequate. The room did get quite stuffy though so we had to open the windows whenever we were in the room to air it. The shower was luke warm and would quickly lose the hot water, but still had good pressure. The various receptionists we saw during our 4 nights here spoke very little English but luckily we didn’t really need to speak to them much ! No breakfast included so you have to head out for food. When the wifi did work it was ok but slow. But it did occasionally',\n 'Pros- fantastic location, nice courtyard and roof terrace and kitchen was great as we could make our own breakfast   Cons- unfortunately none of that really mattered because the walls of the hotel rooms were so thin that we barely slept. As guests came back to the hotel during the night you could hear everything so clearly it was impossible not to be awoken. It finally got quiet around 1.30 am only for the  noise to start again around 3am as guests woke up presumably for early morning pick ups and hikes. For us it was too expensive for failing to provide decent sleep.   In addition the WiFi was really poor most of the time. Finally they provided free coffee but the coffee was rubbish and cups tasted of chlorine- small things but generally really disappointing. Would recommend',\n \"I stayed for 3 weeks as a solo female traveler. Positive: This hotel/ apartments look just like their photos.  They are nice looking...very cozy inside.  Housekeeping was very good but never came when they said they were coming and security was there. The beds were very very comfortable and their was good hot water.  There is a safe in the room which was great, but not sure if you could fit a full sized lap top in it.  For my I-pad it was perfect.  Wireless access was pretty reliable.  Even when I lost access it came back quickly.  Negative:  It's very noisy.  If no-one is on either side of you, it's okay, otherwise you hear everything.  Several times there were people partying quite loudly and went I spoke to the security guard, he spoke to the tenants but nothing changed. \",\n \"Our second time coming back in Antigua. After the recent experience of one hotel we had before, and barely space for the bags we book a triple room.  We booked the room through booking.com. The price was 80 US dollar for the night just before New Year's Eve in 2018.  Good location, many restaurants around. Friendly staff - however, Pablo and Luis don't speak English but tried their best to understand you.  We have the room on the upper floor next to a housekeeping room. At night we hear the laundry machine turning. It bothers me, as I'm not a good sleeper.  The room is okay but there mold on the ceiling. Good free wifi. The bathroom is small, not very clean. Difficult to regulate the hot water for the shower.  - There was a misunderstanding with an airport pick-up.  We book an\",\n \"Being my first time visiting Guatemala I wasn't sure how to evaluate the accommodation options, but one thing I was sure of is that I wanted to have an easy transfer from the airport (45 mins drive) to the hotel as I arrived at 11.30pm o XMas eve. As Posada offered this option and had availability - I booked - it was a GREAT DECISION.  The airport arrival can be overwhelming with the many taxi drivers lurking, and hoards of people waiting to welcome their family members. Our driver has a big clear sign and was an absolute delight!   The drive to Antigua is around 45 mins from the airport. We were thankful to have the hotel transfer as if you're not familiar with where you are, the dark drive can be daunting.  The receptionist was helpful and quick to respond on emails. The room\",\n 'The hotel is quaint, secure, and centrally located. The beds were comfortable, but the cleanliness of our sheets was questionable (stains and hair.) There are windows in the rooms that look into the garden common space, so the airflow in the room was limited, but there was a fan provided. The water pressure was good one day but the next day we had no running water (not sure if this was a freak accident or a common occurrence.) For our 24 hour stay in Antigua, this hotel did the job but will not be too memorable.',\n \"There were 3 of us sharing a room. Each had our own bed. It was clean and basic. The bathroom was a tight fit with only the one mirror. To get hot water, do not turn the pressure on too high. The staff were very kind and accommodating when we asked to move our room downstairs so we wouldn't have to carry our luggage up the narrow stairs.  It is near the center plaza with more than enough places near to eat and shop. Great for walking everywhere.\",\n 'My three young daughters and i stayed in El Marques over Semana Santa.  We were able to walk into town to enjoy the festivities and easily return to El Marques to relax.  The unit was clean, well appointed, and had all of the amenities we needed.  The on-site security and administrative staff were extremely helpful and kind.  They arranged transportation for us, directed us to a variety of activities, advised us on restaurants, and answered our many questions.  We will stay there again!',\n \"Too bad TripAdvisor doesn't allow audio uploads with their reviews. The owners of this place make so much noise at night, talking loud on the courtyard, listening to loud music at 4AM... If you want a good night rest, look further in Antigua \",\n \"Posada de San Jeronimo was a big disappointment. When I saw the room I thought, this is nice. But on closer inspection you soon realise this place was once some dirty hotel that has been made to look nice by painting a wall or two, adding a mood light, a nice design bed sheet... taking some nice photos like you see here, on the FB page. The reality is that the rooms are very dirty, it looked like my floor has not been cleaned in a long time. The bathroom was also bad and no hot water, eventually a bit warm but still a freezing shower. It is also very noisy because it's by the main street. I was in a room furthest away but if anyone talks at reception the noise is amplified by the design of the hotel.

The hotel is beautiful, but keep in mind that if you have a problem it will be a nightmare trying to solve it',\n 'Large and clean room. The rooms are on both sides of a colorful courtyard far away from the lobby but the staff carried our luggage. The hotel garden is full of plants and flowers well arranged. Regular breakfast and the waiters service need improvement.',\n \"Old style hotel on the outskirts of Antigua with excellent views of the surrounding volcanoes from the terrace restaurant. Good clean accommodation although a little basic. Friendly and helpful staff. Restaurant was a little more expensive than restaurants in town which are approx 20-30 mins walk away down Antigua's iconic cobbled streets. Slightly irritated that the hotel charges for bottled drinking water on the rooms and as previously noted some rooms on the exterior of the courtyarded garden suffer from road noise. Small bathing pool to ease those aching legs after a hard day sightseeing \",\n \"As recommended by my guide, I feel the cost of my stay was well worth it.  It's a bit of a walk from the city center (far NE corner of the area where most tourists roam), but definitely not an issue.  Christian and his staff were very accommodating and a pleasure to talk to.  Since part of the hotel is set up like a hostel, there is no shortage of conversation in the outside common area with interesting guests.  I enjoyed watching a local artist paint wall murals near the bunk rooms.  There's also a beautiful garden near the private rooms, and you can catch a nap outside easily if so inclined.  My only issue was I had a bit of trouble keeping warm in the room at night, and would say that the rooms might not be as well insulated as you would expect when the temperature gets down\",\n 'My bed was so hard that my wife took the other single bed as she could not sleep on the hard double. Lucky for her as I endured multiple bed bug bites and she got away scott free. Still itching now as I write this. Expedia promised 15m2 but had a room size of thimble but the great staff sorted it next day. Thanks. Roof top is great for breakfast. Kitchen good for basic meal only. Good for the price.',\n \"Overall the hotel was nice and the service was great. However you do NOT want to be iin Room 101 (or I would suggest 102 or 103) as these are right by the courtyard used for breakfast (set up starts at 05:30am) also any visitors arriving or leaving during the night will wake you. Also for Room 101 the window from the hotel toilet opens out into your bathroom - again noise by anyone using it overnight. Finally if you are there on a Saturday night the live rock band playing at the pub next door is effectively the other side of the wall to this room. We asked to be moved but were told there weren't any suitable rooms available. This was clearly untrue as we saw rooms come and go that were suitable and in a more quite location of the hotel.   All of that said if you aren't in rooms\",\n 'We made a reservation for the only location listed, located just off the Calle del Arco. When we arrived, a gentleman told our driver to take us to the \"other\" location. It was a decent location. The bathrooms were nice, breakfast was good. The best was comfortable. My frustration was that it was not the location we wanted. It was further from the center. Nor was it as charming.',\n 'As this place is so similar to their sister property, Euro Maya Suites, you may see a lot of similarity in reviews.  I returned to Antigua and decided to try this, the older sister, as it was only half a block from The Plaza.  A beautiful small hotel with an excellent staff and nice rooms.   With all the knick-knacks around it could also be a museum. The quirky intermingling of Mezoamerican artifacts and photos of European cities is strange; depending on how you look at it you may consider it charming or annoying.  My room was above average size and comfortable although there was only one somewhat easy chair, and no sofa, so two people would have some difficulties when it came to relaxation. The bathroom was adequate and it had hot water in the shower without having bare wiring',\n 'There was some confusion getting here, we thought we had booked the Euro Maya Suites but ended up at this location after calling to confirm.  Ok, fine.  The room was okay, pretty cramped.  The biggest issue is not only is there no AC, but also no overhead fan and the hotel has no fans to bring it.  It was so stuff and even leaving all windows open for cross-breeze, it was really stuffy.  It was nice to have breakfast on the roof and the breakfast was super plentiful and served by lovely staff.  Location is tops.',\n 'Gorgeous spacious rooms, with a nice tipico breakfast included. The all day complimentary coffee, tea and purified water was very convenient to have. Centrally located.  Unfortunately the shower water was cold.  Be sure to let the front desk know if you plan to return late at night, as we were locked out, despite using the door bell and calling the front desk, exhausted, we had to find alternate accommodations in the middle of the night.  After explaining this to the staff the next morning, we were refunded the fee for the night. ',\n \"We spent two nights here on our way to Lake Atitlan for a service trip.

The public areas were pretty. Wifi worked in our room amd the breakfast area. I wouldn't stay here again.\",\n 'Spent one night and would not return. The downstairs room was subjected to noisy chatter by patrons all night long and even in the early morning (0400). There is a charge for everything - wifi, water.

We have stayed at several hotels in Antigua and have always been very pleased with staff, service and accommodations at other hotels in the area.   This hotel has been the worst we have stayed at by far in this price range.  The receptionist was accommodating but slightly rude.  Definitely not friendly or personable and the staff acted like they didn't know what they were doing most of the time.  We stayed for two nights and politely asked if it was possible to change rooms after the first night because our room was located right next to reception desk which was very noisy and loud from people checking in and out all through the day and night we could not sleep.

The pool was great - very refreshing and so appreciated after a day of sightseeing.

All in all, a great stay.\",\n 'This place was clean and the staff was so helpful! They helped us find places we wanted to go and gave great recommendations! So easy to walk to the main square and right by La Merced.

It is just 2 blocks from the main square and there is traffic, but we kept our windows closed and weren't disturbed. We were offered a cooked, or continental breakfast (which is included in the rate) and ate on their very pretty patio.   We heard no noise from other rooms and my only gripe would be that the bedrooms need more illumination. Hopefully they could do that tastefully without breaking up the colonial decor.   If you are considering this property, be aware that they have a sister hotel called the Palacio Chico 1940, so don't book the wrong hotel. Don’t know why this property sits so low in the TA listings, it is a good option for travelers\",\n 'We stayed here on our final night in Antigua the staff could not have been nicer they answered loads of questions for us and sorted an airport shuttle. The room was spotless and the shuttered windows ensured a solid nights rest. It is a little expensive for what you get in terms of breakfast which was only 2 pieces of toast, 2 small slices of watermelon and pineapple. We asked for eggs which they gave.   Bottled water was free and it is in a nice quiet area of the town.

The hotel del Marques features exclusively suites, we booked a large suite for 6 persons equipped with a kitchen,  and a washer & dryer all of which proved very useful!  The beds were new and very comfy, even the sofa-bed seemed good quality (my kids slept in it, not me though) The hotel is quiet, we couldn't hear any of the other guests, however the design of the suite is such that you'll hear from the bedroom located\",\n 'Sweet little hotel in the heart of downtown Antigua, Guatemala. Beautiful courtyard, sweet, tiny rooms. The beds are a bit hard, the shower took a bit to find the sweet spot, but overall enjoyed the two days spent here. We came via an Explorica tour. ',\n 'Clean hotel in a good location but when we checked out, the front desk clerk showed us an old ripped hand towel and said it had been found in our room and we must pay for it.  We did not rip the towel but were charged $9 for it anyway.  Will not stay here again.',\n 'We stayed for two night at this hotel. We had a room on the second floor. The first night we had two twin bed on the second night we were able to get a double bed in our room without changing the room which was very nice. The hot water was a little bit hard to regulate in the shower. The first night was quiet but the second night there was a big group of volunteers staying at the hotel which made a lot of noise late at night and early in the morning. The location of the hotel is very good near the central park.',\n 'Excellent hotel. Had a lovely outdoor eating area with small kitenette. Rooms were spacious and comfortable, bathroom was clean with good water pressure. Great central location near the main plaza, grocery store and markets. Staff spoke english well enough. We were able to book our pacaya volcano climb here for the next morning. They also book shuttles and if they dont have the specific service youre after there is a travel agent next door. The only thing that wouldve made this stay perfect would have been hot water in the shower. ',\n \"Not really clean hotel, smells bad and very noisy over night. It's quite close to the parque central though and the guardians were friendly.  For such price (320Q), its possible to find much better addresses in Antigua.\",\n 'Our room had three beds and a TINY bathroom.  It was very clean.  The room was furnished simply, but it was very adequate.  We had a lower floor room, but I think upstairs might be quieter.  There is no air conditioning, so the upper floor might be pretty warm in the summer.',\n 'It’s on the outside of town which means large coaches can stop here so groups like it and although at night on the whole it’s quieter than sleeping in town as it also caters for functions and we had one evening where we were disturbed by a band quite late into the night.  Add to this the tour groups arriving and departing in the nighttime hours and voices and suitcases bumping along the cobbles reverberating around the complex and it doesn’t always make for a peaceful sleep.  It looks OK on the surface and is tastefully done up to look like an old colonial town and has a nice courtyard garden area but it lacks charm or personality, the staff aren’t particularly friendly, the rooms are rather dated and certainly the ground floor ones smelt damp and needed airing, and the beds',\n 'I stayed for two nights with my family in late December.  The hotel setting (grounds, buildings, ambiance) is five stars and amazing.  Kudos to the hotel for improving the museums, which are really interesting and worth a visit whether or not you stay at this hotel.  However, the food and room were not too impressive- three stars.  The room smelled smoky as there was a fireplace and a little card that instructed people not to have fires... well, then maybe you should take out the wood of the fireplace so that people do not light fires!  We had two meals at the hotel- an average breakfast with very slow service and sandwiches at the pool, which were not very good. All in all, an enjoyable 2 days, but the hotel could do better.',\n 'It was nicely located just 5min from city. Nice to have breakfast on the rooftop. Rooms and hotel was quite nice. The service as well, they can also help you with tours. You have working wifi there too.',\n 'Hotel is very centric which is good but ended up awake at 3am by the sound of other room alarm and noisy guests checking out, rooms dont have any sound control plus have poor ventilation and get quite warm (no vents and no a/c).  Beds are squeaky and not that confortable.  The bathroom is horribly decorated.   Overall for the price (over 100 usd) I am sure there are better other choices.',\n 'The communal areas here are lovely. Grear coffee too. But the first room I got given absolutely stank of a stong chemical smell which I can only imagine is the floor cleaner. I asked to be moved, 5 minutes jn there made me nauseous. The next room also smelled old and is run down.  Road noise very loud!  The mattress doesnt have a mattress protector, the  thin  fitted sheet goes straight on the matress which is just gross. Thumbs down for me.',\n 'This hotel is a cosy little oasis, set in the lovely colonial town of Antigua. The courtyard within the hotel is beautiful and its landscape ; simple and yet stunning , making us feel right at home. It’s just great to be able to chill at the courtyard sipping coffee or a beer.  The staffs are all friendly and very helpful, passionate and knowledgeable. The staff helped us booked most of our activities at great prices and we are so grateful for all the tips. The rooms are big, simple and yet functional . Hot water is available but can take a few minutes to flow through the shower, so a little of patience help.  Overall this is a nice place to stay, and i would recommend checking it out.',\n 'This is a very nice 3 Star Hotel. Not in the center of the town, but not far from everything. Just 4 blocks away from the Main Plaza (Parque Central de la Antigua Guatemala). I would say the location, a little bit away is better to have a tranquil night. The hotel itself does not show all the beauty from the outside. There is a big wood door that is kept closed all day and night. But inside you will be presented by a huge garden very well taken care of. There is no parking. People are very attentive and always smiling. The room is very comfy, good bed, small tv that I did not try. In my room (19) there was 2 queen beds. My only complain is the shower, difficult to get to a constant water temperature. Sometimes too hot, sometimes colder. But nothing that bothered too much. I do',\n 'We found the staff at the hotel very friendly. The room had charm as well as all the amenities we needed. Even though our room faced the street the wood shutters kept it quiet. We loved the option of having breakfast on either the rooftop patio or at the buffet at Porto. Plus being able to use the pool at Porto was great. The location is very good. I would definitely recommend this hotel. Thanks for a nice stay!',\n \"The hostel is very clean, I felt like there was always someone busily cleaning throughout the day.  Maria on reception is fantastic and organised Spanish lessons for me with an awesome  private tutor that I had at the hostel.   The location is awesome. A 30 second walk to the square and loads of nice resteraunts and bars. It's not a very sociable hostel (but then I was staying in a private room).However because it is so close to lots of sociable bars (particularly the snug/ travel menu) this wasn't a problem.\",\n \"I spent 2 night at Hostal Antigua sleeping in the big dorm at the end of the open air corridor; the dorm is spacious enough, with comfortable beds, lockers, and direct access to clean toilets. Up the stairs, you'll find a lovely terrace where you can eat your own breakfast, as a comfortable kitchen is available! Staff was gentle and willing to book shuttles for us.\",\n 'Nice place for a few nights!  Dorms have comfy beds, and there is a nice patio and kitchen on the roof.  Bathrooms could be a bit cleaner, but definitely workable.  Helpful staff as well.  They provide good lockers with a key.',\n 'Good location, clean and nice room, but not so big. Staff was unfriendly and unhelpful - additionally not speaking English. Hostel for people who like peace and quiet. Curfew in force since 22 hours. Generally a bit expensive.',\n \"Charming hotel in a charming town though be mindful of the cobbled stone streets not the most user friendly surface. The hotel is central and offers only breakfast, the sticky muesli is very good, the service is a little nonchalant but you're on holiday so don't stress. There is a roof terrace which offers a nice view of the volcanoes.\",\n 'A lovely, quirkily elegant hotel with rooms leading off the internal courtyards and verandahs.  Our first floor room wasn’t that big, but was clean and comfortable with traditional colonial decor.  We found it quiet for sleeping at night.   The shower was really good - always a big plus for us.  Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is served in the beautiful courtyard full of ferns and flowers, which can be a bit chilly  (my follically challenged companion had to wear his woolly hat!) but we were told there was an unusually cold front coming through!  Not a huge choice of food, but the fruit was excellent, and the traditional breakfast of eggs, plantain, salsa and refried beans was nice.  The hotel is centrally located so it’s easy to walk to all areas of Antigua',\n 'Very conveniently located a block of the main plaza.  This was a first time visit to Euro Maya selected mainly on the basis of reviews on Trip Advisor.  In retrospect, it may be safe to stay a night in any given location and search for an alternative if the first night does not meet to your satisfaction.  The location is excellent, but if you are not capable of walking up a flight of steep stairs, then this place may pose a challenge for you.  The front desk help will assist you with the bags, but maybe not so much if you have a very early check out the next morning.  This is a simply furnished hotel among many similar offerings.  One thing of note, the prices had dropped considerably since I made reservations on line several months ago.  Sometimes, if you are so inclined, it',\n \"What a great impression this place made, on the last day of our travels. We arrived late and our daughter, who had a bad stomach, hadn't eaten and was craving a soy-milk banana smoothie (she's a New Yorker, say no more). The lovely Argentinean host ran out to the supermarket, got soy milk and delivered a delicious smoothie to our room. So kind! Our family room consisted of a pristine, spacious room with two big double beds, a smaller room with bunk beds, and a bathroom. Comfortable beds, lovely white sheets, and so conveniently located right in the center of the city. Excellent value.\",\n 'I have already reviewed this hotel and EuroMaya Suites, but I read some of the other reviews and I am disturbed by some peoples attitude and expectations. I have no affiliation with either Hotel do not know the owners, but I did meet one of the owners once and she was very friendly. Somebody wrote that the rooms were the size of a broom closet where my half joking complaint about the Euro Maya Suites was it was such a long walk from the Master bedroom to the washroom as room 15 is enormous and is an actual suite with a king size bed and 60 inch flat screen for $50 US, Yes the rooms at the Euro Maya Hotel are smaller but they do charge less. to the reviewer that arrived on December 30th and complained about bait and switch, You arrived the day before New years Eve, you were lucky',\n \"This is our 3 visit to this hotel in the past few years. Can't beat the central location, 1 block from the main square. The hotel is nice and quiet for such a central spot. All the rooms open onto a central courtyard.  We stayed on the second floor - room 5 and my sister and Husband in Room 4. Room 5 had a double and single bed, Room 4, one queen sized bed. The beds with very comfortable with nice bedding and good pillows. Lovely flat screen TV's with Sky TV, so many many channels in English. Good, high speed internet. Not the strongest signal in our room, but excellent in the central courtyard.  A rooftop deck with some fabulous views. Not much furniture for sitting up on the roof deck.  The price included breakfast - traditional fare - eggs, beans, cheese, plantain, and toast.\",\n 'Shared a room with 2 friends, we were satisfied so we decided to stay in this hostel for all our nights. The room was not expensive and the breakfast included was very good, we even had a choice of breakfast.',\n 'The location was perfect, right around the corner from the market and grocery store. The employees were great and courteous. The rooms were ok, nothing grand or special, typical Guatemalan hotels. Old looking inside etc...The rooms were hot though. I had to ask for a second fan because it felt like a sauna inside, while the temperature was cool outside. The WIFI was great on the 1st floor, not so great on the 3rd deck patio. It is cheap, but they charge by the day on WIFI. A disappointment for the cost of the hotel, it should be included. The lowere level has a dining/living room area with a fountain that is nice to chill. The patio is nice as well with great views and lots of seating.',\n \"We enjoyed our time here and the place was very clean with good sized rooms. There is a nice roof terrace where you can sit and enjoy the views. There's a kitchen you can use if you want. Some people in reviews complained about it being noisy, this was not an issue for us.\",\n \"We were happy to find a pet-friendly hotel a few blocks from the main plaza so we were able to visit a lot of Antigua landmarks with our small dog. Rooms are spacious and clean. Other than that, this hotel was overpriced and noisy. Also, there's no free internet because wi-fi signal within reach belongs to an internet cafe within the hotel itself but -tricky enough- it's run by some else (or so they say). No overnight parking near the place either.\",\n \"This posada is an ok place to stay for one night, just don't expect to sleep much. You can here everything that happenens in other rooms. Some rooms do not have any windows. Beds don't smell like if sheets have been washed properly. Internet is not included in the tariff and the staff is quite impersonal and distant. There are better and cheaper places to stay in Antigua, just saying...\",\n \"Stayed here twice in the last two weeks:  Positives - free near the main square, market and loads of other attractions. Has a supermarket two door down and a small kitchen where you can cook and store food. Has a lovely roof top terrace with great views. Staff are all friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean and spacious.   Negatives - there is no free wifi! This was a real sticking point for me, as the hotel advertises free wifi, yet you have to pay Q20 every 24 hours for the wifi code, which they will type into your device so you can't share it with others. They also turned off the internet each night at 8pm and it didn't come back on again until 8am. This was very disappointing as we needed the internet to help plan our trip and activities. Also, like most people said, choose\",\n 'This is a cute hotel with a lot of character with great staff and a wonderful location.  It includes breakfast and is only a few steps from one of the main squares.  The main issue some people may have with it is the fact that it is next door to a club / night club so the noise level may be a bit much for any rooms on the one side of the hotel with rooms farther away still close enough to \"hear\" the music / beat of the club.',\n \"Nice staff but not worth the money.  I made a mistake of prepaying for the room to get some discount, however I end up paid the penalty to checked out early and move to different hotel. My wife and I stayed for four nights. Four out of three nights, I could hear person next room snoring. Wall doesn't have much insulation. Breakfast was coffee and piece of bread. We did not eat breakfast at at all, only coffee we had..  There are much better options in Antigua.\",\n 'This small hotel is conveniently located, close to the central park in Antigua. Rooms are standard, but are clean and have what you need. Breakfast is straight forward and value for money is good. A good option for a night.',\n \"The hotel staff are all really nice.  We stayed two nights while attending a wedding at the church next door. The rooms are decent but not spectacular and we've stayed at other hotels in town for much less that are better. The passing traffic makes the hotel shake and the breakfast offered is two pieces of bread with a very small portion of fruit. I will not stay here again. \",\n 'I worked with Hotel Palacio Chico 1850 as a volunteer team came down from the US. It was a great experience to work with those at the front, who were very attentive to the needs of the group. They have wonderful administration as well as clean and lovely rooms.',\n \"Warm, well decorated clean rooms. We had a beautiful view of the mountains and a nearby old church from the second floor. Hot shower, wifi was good, the desk clerk girl was very sweet and helpful. Very reasonably priced, and close to the center. The only critique is that the man who let us in around 10pm had obviously been drinking, not very professional. It's not necessarily our first pick but we would go back. \",\n \"I hate to give Posada Dona Luisa a bad review. The people are lovely, rooms are clean and bright. We stayed Feb 8-10: Monday was fine with a beautiful view of Volcan de Fuego erupting.  Tuesday and Wednesday the thumping disco beat started about 10:30 and went very late. Was probably from the top floor of the pizza restaurant next door.  We didn't investigate so we don't know if it's permanent but earplugs were mandatory. \",\n \"In a good location one block from Parque Central,  this homely posada features a nice garden courtyard,  rooftop  terrace and  clean simple rooms.  You can get better value by booking directly with the hotel so maybe bypass the online bookings.  the ladies at reception were welcoming and helpful, I enjoyed my stay.  They don't provide breakfast but there are many places along the road or in the town square, I guess that is what a posada is about...\",\n 'Stayed in Antigua for 2 days at this small hotel. The best thing about this hotel is the very central placement - only one block away from the very nice square Placa Central. The hotel is more like at hostel - with at shared kitchen and roof top terrace - however it is not possible to buy anything in this hotel. Anyway - is you are there to see the city is is at perfect place for only a few days.',\n 'This hotel was a great place to stay in Antigua. It was central to everything, the park, markets, restaurants and bars. It has  the old colonial feel to it. The beds and pillows comfortable, great WiFi, hot water, free drinking water, free coffee and tea. Beer for sale in cooler, cheap price. Nice courtyard and a top terrace with great views. Very secure. The best though is the staff was very friendly and helpful. The only down side, is that the terrace needs new cushions for chairs and to be more inviting, so much potential there. We would definitely stay there again. Oh ya and they store your stuff for you if you are coming back as we did after spending a week at Lago de Atitlan.',\n 'I was hoping to stay at another smaller hotel but it was fully booked for the dates we wanted so we ended up staying here. The courtyard is very cute and I like the hanging plants throughout the property. The room is pretty bland and nothing to write home about. The roof top is neat, but be very careful going up and down the stairs - some of the steps are very small. The location is good. They also have very fast laundry service (we got ours done within 3 hours). ',\n 'Probably should have paid another $20 for the night and got a much nicer hotel.  Good location.  Friendly staff.  Community kitchen just in case you want cook your own dinner?  Nice view from terrace but byob ',\n 'We stayed here for a week as part of a package. The hotel was nice, but would not have been my first choice due to lack of amenities. Especially given that we were hiking, biking, and kayaking, I would prefer somewhere with a pool or hot tub.   The room was clean and comfortable.  Clean bath towels daily, but only one hand towel and one wash cloth for 3 people.   The package had us away for two nights out of the week. The hotel staff charged $1 per bag for storage, which is ridiculous. They coordinate with the tour operator for the cost of the room, and knew we would be out for two separate nights, and still charged us. The menat the front desk were apologetic.  The woman was prickly and borderline rude. I told them we would pay all charges at checkout, but they asked for the',\n 'Awesome base in Antigua. Really close to the city square, great pubs and food and very easy to navigate around.   The view on the rooftop at night was my favourite! To sit upstairs and be able to see Volcan de Fuego erupting was a real treat.   The staff are incredibly friendly and professional, the only downside being beers are extremely overpriced, so buy them from a corner store.  The rooms are clean, comfortable and there is a laundry service at the hotel (also very expensive compared to local rates)',\n 'Stayed here on two occasions and in both cases it was a perfect base in Antigua. The suites are about 5 blocks from the central square of Antigua - walking along cobbled streets. Its in a quiet part of town with all rooms on two levels surrounding a very pleasant internal courtyard. The roof top is large and has some seating and tables - great for some late night drinks looking at the volcano under the stars. The rooms are reasonable size with good facilities - a great shower and bed. We did not have breakfast included so went out each morning (there are some great options nearby. The property does not have a restaurant. The reception seems to be manned 24/7 and sold a small range of essentials and drinks. The property fees very secure with a door that is locked late evening.

The description says it is two blocks south of the central park square, but it is almost a four block walk.  The main door is kept locked at all times, and you have to ring a bell for entry. We all felt very safe there, and we found the rooms to be quaint and clean. The proximity to the park square makes it easy to enjoy the sights and dining in Antigua.',\n 'My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights (3 before a tour and 2 with a tour). The hotel was very clean, the terrace was lovely and staff were friendly and helpful. The place seemed quite secure as the front doors were locked at all times and you had to buzz to get in. We originally had a room by the roadside and it was a bit noisy in the early morning, but we were able to change rooms given it was low season. The hot water works, but requires a bit of patience. Bottled water provided daily was appreciated. The location was good - walking distance to Parque Central and Caobo Farm. Overall, a good hotel and we had a comfortable stay.',\n \"I arrived here 10pm after travelling for over 30 hours back in April 2017, to find out they hadn't booked me a room.

Bathroom inside the room and a little TV. The hotel isn’t quiet, the noise starts around 5am and that kept our puppy up since.

I caught her peeking at me through the window as I was leaving the kitchen area. I noticed she was pretty rosy with the other guests though.

Christian at the front desk was very helpful and found us a new hotel and we thank him for that. The hotel did not reimburse or compensate us in any way.

This room was even cheaper, smaller, had no windows and was right next to the front desk. As a result, we ended up in a $20 room. Posada Don Valentino lied to us and stole our money. Do not stay in a hotel staffed by liars.',\n \"This is a cute little hotel in a great location, close to the main square and restaurants. Rooms are basic but clean and functional with a tiny bathroom. The staff were friendly, spoke English and were happy to recommend places to see and restaurants to try. Wi-fi is available, but can be spotty.  My two big complaints: 1) If you get a room along the hallway close to the reception desk, it will be IMPOSSIBLE to sleep. The walls are paper thin and you can hear the receptionists chatting, guests checking in and out. It felt like people were yelling as they were stomping up and down the hallway. Forget about taking afternoon naps or turning in early. It doesn't quiet down till past 11pm and even then there are people returning from their late nights out, etc. 2) Water pressure was\",\n \"The rooms were clean, safe, and quiet. The front desk was very friendly and spoke adequate English. There is a guard at night and you will have to show them the key to get back into the room, the guard doesn't speak as much English but is still quite nice. There is also a kitchen, a sitting room with dozens of books to read (mostly dated, many different languages, some are regional guide books), multiple sunny outdoor patios, and a pay per use internet cafe. Our room also had a TV, I didn't use it though. Not a luxury hotel but definitely an adequate base of operations.\",\n 'This hotel is run by the same people that also run Casa Rustica and Casa Antiga. If you look at the websites, the same pictures are used and mostly feature Casa Rustica. Its the least expensive of them because of the location, i think, which is several blocks away from the main center - about a five minute walk. Not a big deal, though, and still very convenient.   We paid $30 for a night, and had a large room with private bath and two beds. It had a TV, but i cant really say cable was included because the signal was awful (but who is really in Antiga to watch tv?!). Wifi here is best accessible from the main living area. Its clean, very basic. There is a huge grocery store just a block down the street, so its easy to get food and supplies from here. If youre a budget traveler,',\n 'I have stayed here 4 times now, and I loved it each time. Room is clean, has a TV and warm water in the shower. Beds are comfy and the staff are helpful. Have to pay for wifi, which is downside. Other than that, no problem :)',\n \"This is a nice hotel, centrally located, in Antigua.  I stayed there for two nights recently and was glad to have found it.  It's clean.  The gentleman who works there, Hugo, is a really good guy who speaks perfect English.  The owner Luis is a nice man as well.  The only drawback is they do not serve any breakfast but coffee is made at 7am.  Centainly a worthwhile stay......\",\n 'This is a truly unique hotel, with antique furnishings and interesting decoration. It has to be seen to be appreciated. It was comfortable, clean and well located. The staff were fantastic- friendly and helpful. Luis was so welcoming and went out of his way to assist us throughout our stay. The roof terrace has great views and the court yard is lovely and peaceful. ',\n \"I stayed here for one night and the bathroom flooded twice. Once in the afternoon, which took us by surprise and caused a dangerous slip. The bathroom flooded again, this time over night,  and came to our attention at 5am.  The whole floor was ankle deep in water and extended out to the courtyard. Our nights sleep was disturbed and our luggage on the floor was soaking wet. The manager refused to reimburse us or provide some discount for our bad experience. From a customer care perspecrive the hotel was run very poorly. We were offered breakfast as a gesture for the inconvenience, which while appreciated didn't compensate us adequately. Such a pity as location of hotel is good and has huge potential if only the bathrooms worked properly.\",\n 'The hotel is just steps from Central Park, from here you can do everything just walking, the hotel is like a big house with a lot of rooms around, a nice garden area and really fun pool, my room was amazing I had maybe the best views from any room, the staff was always helpful with our needs.  Pros: location, staff, views, price for the money  Cons: pool water is cold, bathroom is weird, location... if you need to relax maybe this is not for you on weekend cause next door are some bars that have some noise till midnight.',\n 'Rooms and premises are just great. Nice views. Swimming pool is a big plus (we travel with kids). But.... rooms are VERY noisy. Our room was next to the cafe/bar next door, extremely loud music. We asked for an other room, luckily there was one, at the other side. But even there we could here the music very, very loud. If you want to party and go to bed late, you probably have no problem with it, but if you want an early night.... do not go here.',\n 'This is a nice hotel close to the Parque Central, in the middle of Antigua, decorated with local flavors. It has a swimming pool and nice patio.  The rooms are nice, some have good views, specially in the upper floor. Because of the central location, we experienced some noise in the night from card and people shouting.  The service is good as in every hotel in Guatemala, and the price in line with the offer.',\n \"The hotel staff is nice and friendly, the rooms are clean and there is a very nice pool. Unfortunatly there is a lot of noise on the street which makes the hotel less attracktive if you stay with small children. If you don't mind, going to bed late, wonderfull place to stay!\",\n 'the hotel is located in a very old biulding, only a few minutes walk from the main square and the cathedral, rooms are big and stylishly decorated, there is a patio inside with trees and places to relax, breakfast is small but very tasty and fresh, oposite the hotel is a very nice local restaurant with great food and low prices',\n 'There are two rooms in the back of the hotel next to housekeeping which are uninhabitable. Do Not accept these rooms. They are nowhere near the standards of the other rooms.That is why the reviews here are so inconsistent.',\n 'Great location. Very nice and helpful staff. The hotel has a lovley garden. It feels very homie and safe. The shower head was broken and therfore the shower stream was terible. There is no fan in the room. The room is stale, like most rooms in antigua.  A little bit too expensive',\n 'This hotel has a very friendly and helpful staff. Our room was comfortable and had plenty of space. The courtyard is very pretty, and they have hammocks, wifi, and pure water. The location is great. The breakfast was simple, but overall we had a lovely stay.',\n 'Price was okay: 90GTQ for a single room/shared bathroom with breakfast. Not very busy at the time  I was there. Staff is nice. Breakfast: There are options but a bit light ... e.g. one egg hot the hot option and tiny amount of yogurt for the fruit option... No towel, wifi OK. The outer door closes around 7:30 pm   Walk-in price is better than online.',\n 'Yay!  I found a private room at Hostel Casa Jacaranda for the same cost in the dorms of the “party” hostels in Antigua.  Given I like to party and socialize but I like my privacy more.  So when I found this quaint private room with breakfast included I was a happy camper.  Super clean room and facilities. Good security at night too.  Nice staff and overall a quiet hostel.  ',\n \"Pleasant hostel which was good value. Staff were helpful and friendly while the breakfast was ok without being special. Good place if you're on a budget, lots of the cheaper tour companies are in this area of Antigua and only a short walk to Parque le Merced for cheap street food in the evenings.\",\n 'We stayed for two nights in Casa Jacaranda. We had a private bedroom with nice beds and enough space. The hostel is very clean, all day long the sweet staff is cleaning rooms, bathrooms and floors. We used the shared bathrooms which were sufficient. Best part about Casa Jacaranda is the nice breakfast in the garden. The food and the coffee were awesome and a nice start for a long day!  Casa Jacaranada is a good hostel for a fair price situated near the city centre of Antigua. The breakfast in de the garden is awesome!',\n 'I stayed in the only small room in the hotel on the main floor which I suspect makes a big difference. It had next to no natural light and I found it cold. It was also a bit loud from upstairs and reception. That said, it was a good deal, it is quite lovely inside, the staff were great, it had free water and the included breakfast at Don Diego is one of my favs in town. So all in all it was a good stay. ',\n 'There are two units on the top floor, one with a rooftop view of the volcano and La Merced. My wife and I stayed in that one, \"Catedral,\" for four nights. We were afraid there would be a stampede of drunks on the roof every night, but we didn\\'t hear a peep. It\\'s a layer of concrete between the top and the room. The staff was friendly. They didn\\'t even get mad at me for making coffee in the general area–I wake up at 5 am–using our bag of grounds every morning. We had WiFi issues, but not the hotel\\'s fault. I tested their speeds at 8-9 Mbps, but it would drop to 0 intermittently, indefinitely. It seemed, the whole town was that way. Had I needed the WiFi for work, it would have been a problem. There is parking, but it\\'s $18/day for 24/7 parking. Our reservation came with free',\n 'The hotel is perfectly located in the city centre, in 2-minute walk from Plaza Mayor / Parque Central. Its rooms are spacious and clean, and a courtyard with a fountain adds something positive. However, the entrance is almost unnoticeable from the street (see photo). Panoramic views from the terrace at the third level are perfect. While staying there, I could see an eruption of one of nearby volcanos. English-speaking receptionists are friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, breakfasts were not offered at all. Hotel staff recommended me a partner restaurant near Arco de Santa Catarina. Just by chance, I came across a small café between the hotel and Plaza Mayor (5a Calle Poniente, between 5a and 6a Avenida Sur – see photo) that served only breakfasts between 06:30 am and 11:30 am,',\n 'Great location, only a couple blocks from the main square. Free coffee available from early morning, free distilled water available in multiple locations within the hotel, quiet setting around a large colonial quad, and an incredible rooftop area that you usually have to yourself. Very helpful staff. We climbed Volcan Acatenango and returned to San Vicente for one last night, which felt like paradise after such an exhausting adventure!  It was not that full when we were there.',\n 'We stayed here with our family (including two 6 & 8 year boys) and enjoyed our stay. The rooms are good sized and we used the wel equipped kitchen al lot to be able to give our boys a taste of home at times. For USD 5 you can use the pool at one of their more luxureous hotels. For beautiful sunsets check out the roof terrace!',\n 'We stayed at Hotel Posada for two nights, crashing there after arriving from the Guatemala City airport and before heading off to Atitlan. It was just fine for these purposes. It felt clean and secure and was right in the thick of things in Antigua. We were able to spend a whole day exploring on foot.   Like everywhere else in Central America, the beds were harder than what we are used to in the US. However, you are not going to get fancy, imported, fluffy, foreign beds for this price. Sheets were clean and towels were provided.  We used the airport transfer, which was SUCH a convenience. The staff helped us book our bus to Atitlan, and they were able to watch our bags in the time between check out and our bus pick-up. There is a small courtyard in which to sit and drink beer',\n 'Great little stay in the heart of Antigua! Close to everything and very central. Though it was simple, the hotel was clean and had everything we needed. We stayed in a big group and they were easily able to accommodate to everyone.',\n 'Staff in the morning were very rude and loud at 6am, No wifi which they told me there was when i arrived late at night in need of internet to get in touch with other people i was meant to be traveling with. Also said it was cheaper that night then the morning charged me more. Bugs all in the bathroom in the morning from out of the rotten wooden door. The only up was location close to cafe where i could get wifi which was apparently down in the area …..',\n 'This was a nice hotel with helpful staff. The rooms were comfortable and the whole place seemed very secure (front doors of the hotel were locked at all times and required you to get buzzed in). Purified water was available on the second floor for you to refill your bottle. Pretty close walking distance to the city plaza.',\n \"Good location, clean , a bit noisy, not much character  Roof area could be utilised much better, they could do so much more with this area  There are better options in Antigua, but this hotel is fine if you don't have a choice (group trip, etc)\",\n 'Location is great, very central to town center.

The rooms and the bathrooms are a bit on the small size. Closet space is limited or none existent depending on the room. Lighting in the rooms is poor. The water pressure in the showers is excellent. The mattresses are super firm, almost too firm. The room had plenty of blankets and very comfortable pillows.  The grounds are beautiful. Water and coffee are available in the common areas 24 hours a day. The coffee always tasted fresh. Security at the hotel is outstanding. The ladies working the front desk were always smiling and helpful.  Breakfast was slow but tasty. Only one person was working the breakfast buffet and she was\",\n 'Good location and plenty of greenery and flowers. Stayed recently for 5 nights within 2 week period in 3 different double rooms - I would recommend 105 and 113 over 117 which is smaller and lacks some things that the other two have. All rooms were very clean and well maintained. Breakfast basic but tasty. Internet painfully slow',\n 'Had 3 nights at beginning our cycling trip and one at end. Short, 10mins or so, walk from main plaza, pleasantly quiet, clean comfortable rooms. Coffee, tea and water always available. Breakfast good, best if you can select night before. Seemed good value for money. As has been mentioned the room nearest the entrance can be a bit noisy and people often turn up quite late as flights into Guatemala City from Europe arrive about 9pm.',\n \"Woke up at 3am for the 4am airport shuttle, and found these nasty creatures crawling on the sheets. So disgusted and worried about spreading them to my home.   I stayed at a different property of the same owner and it was nice and clean, and I didn't see evidence of bugs there. When they didn't have available rooms, they referred me here and it was a completely different experience.\",\n \"I had been travelling for 17 hours on shuttle and got there and they were probably a bit too strict for my liking. Couldn't even go to the kitchen to make myself a cup of tea before bed as it shuts ridiculously early. Though I must say it is a clean, safe and reliable Hostal. I just didn't enjoy my time there now. Also I myself am not a smoker but note you will have to leave the hostel and go into the street to smoke.\",\n \"Stayed 3 nights with my partner in a double ensuite room. Rooms are small, clean & comfortable. This is a small & quiet hostel and in an excellent location. There's a St Martin bakery just across the road, and lots of bars and restaurants nearby. Definitely a good choice if you're looking for budget accommodation. Nice views of the volcano from the terrace but unfortunately they shut it early. Wifi ok. Staff friendly - they organised early transportation to the airport in Guatemala City for us.\",\n 'We stayed 3 nights , the staff are very kind, the host speak fluently english and was very helpful with everything.  Location is a bit far from center town (4-5 min walk) but no big issue..  The price is high  for a private room even though we got a discount for long stay.. hot water is tricky  , breakfast includes and was awesome!! Free water fill and a ping pong table :)',\n \"Think it was run by a Californian family, the boy that was on reception was very cute and appeared to run the whole hostel in a very organised, professional and efficient manner. He was welcoming, attentive and helpful - a credit to the hostel. The rooms were clean and came with fluffy blankets which was a nice addition. Advertised as hot showers but we didn't have a hot one during our stay - not sure why? The free breakfast included is great. The pancakes were large and very tasty. If you want a different breakfast or to add or remove something from your dish they are very accommodating. Best free coffee served during breakfast too!! The wifi works really well and it's only a short 5 min walk into the Central Park and 900metres away from the lookout so great spot. \",\n 'Casa Encantada was a great place to stay. It’s not far from the center of Antigua and I felt completely safe. The hotel is very small and you will not find the amenities of a larger hotel. But every person that worked the front desk greeted me by name every time I saw them, which is something you don’t normally get. The hotel also has a sister property up the street and all guests at Casa Encantada can use their facilities (pools, retaurants etc.)  I’ve read other reviews that complain about how noisy it is. And it’s true you do hear noise coming from the street. But I also stayed at a higher end hotel during my trip and had the same problem. Noise is just normal here. If you need complete silence when you sleep then I would suggest bringing earplugs.   Thanks Casa Encantada.',\n \"First,  the new woman who runs the place is very nice and very helpful.  BUT, this place is no longer a quiet hotel but a hostel.  People were chatting in the courtyard until I finally asked them to stop at 2:30.  As a hostel I'm sure it is fine, but I would not recommend it for quiet.  It's also not as clean as it used to be.\",\n 'We stayed at the lovely Casa Santo Domingo. Arriving here is so nice.   Especially in the evening when all candles are lit, it is a very elegant place to arrive to after flying into busy Guatemala city. All of Antigua is so beautiful and worth a visit when in Guatemala.   We liked staying at this hotel very much. The rooms were nicely connected and located in a quiet area of the Hotel. The hotel is also a museum which is an amazing additional facility as walking through the hotel is truly fascinating. The staff is very kind, although less than 50% speaks basic English. Rooms were nice, hotel’s pool is child-friendly. Spa facilities were nice, massage was very good. Location is excellent. Restaurant was nice, room service was great. We can recommend staying here with children.',\n \"Left after they changed a confirmed rate, try to steal credit card informations found policies which were not right, the staff looks really incompetent, told me first by credit card they would reserve $100, after I refused they told me on debit card they can authorize $ 200, I refused so they told me I can deposit $200, cash also that I refused he called the manager which was hiding somewhere, he told me they will make an acception and do not charge me, I agreed but they make a copy of my card on a paper so that's fraud and not authorized data theft, specially I refused since beginning. Take care that they not steal your data and check rates on booking.com as they try to trick you on prices.\",\n \"Pretty, comfortable and clean. Upstairs loft large bedroom and bed and downstairs sitting room and bath.  Shower had drain problems that were addressed by removing drain lid.  Breakfast (or sac lunch) okay and appropriate.  Thin walls and not thoughtful guests a problem (and chicken bus callers in early am), otherwise a quiet and convenient location. Weak WIFI modem (I requested  a close room from other reviews) only had signal downstairs or in lobby, not in bedroom.  I was only in room from 6 pm to 7 am because of work.  Travel agent in lobby on weekends (? weekdays) was great for excursions.  All staff were friendly and very willing to help, but many didn't speak or barely spoke English.  Alicia Estrada was the main desk staff person who spoke English well, always smiled, and\",\n \"Built in the traditional style around a central courtyard, this hotel has both noise and air circulation problems. The surrounds are quiet at night, but all it takes is one guest or group doing something as simple as having a chat outside their room, and everyone can hear it. Once the windows are closed there is no air circulation and the room becomes quite humid. Bed was reasonably comfortable, but the polyester blanket increased the discomfort caused by poor air circulation. The hottest the water got was tepid. Room was clean and spacious and breakfast was perfectly adequate.  There are no facilities for the secure safekeeping of passports and valuables. If you're catching an early flight - ours was the 6.30 to Flores - consider a taxi or private shuttle. The 4am shuttle\",\n \"I think the place is appropriate.  Great location. Half a block away from the central park.  Had an issue with hot water the first day I was there.  No hot water after coming back from climbing pacaya. Had to take a cold water shower. Staff was accomodating but not being able to count on hot water is a problem. Got it resolved. Thank you.  Front rooms are noisy. And don't let them give you the room above reception. No pool. Breakfast was good. I'm fine with black beans, plantains, and some eggs. No hot water on the bathroom sink. So shaving for guys is tricky if you use a blade.  Consider how many people have submitted reviews for this hotel. \",\n 'Stayed here (not Euro Maya Suites) for one night but would have enjoyed more nights had my itinerary allowed.  The room was pleasant, the bed comfortable and included a couch/foton..  There is a big window at the front of the room and one at the rear that opened to an adjoining building.  The room has an LCD TV with a variety of free channels and pay per view.  The bathroom was good sized and included a hair blower; hot water was available almost instantaneously.   The building has ample places to sit and relax outside any room.  Tables and chairs are positioned on the walkway around the atrium which provides an open air feel.   Breakfast was provided in a nice cozy little dining area but was unremarkable.  Juice, coffee, breads, and cold cereal were served.

It has an excellent atmosphere and included breakfast.  It is close to everything, and super clean.  The only complaint is that we could hear some noise on the street in the morning, but that was completely overshadowed by how wonderful our room was.  We had a two story loft, and it was gorgeous.  I am from Guatemala City but live in the U.S., I would definitely recommend this hotel.  Great prices and overall wonderful stay.',\n 'We have stayed here many times. Always treated like family by Luis (owner) and Hugo (#1 back up to Luis) and Clara (housekeeping and more). This was one of our longest stays (7 nights). We were treated to an eruption by the volcano Fuego. About 11 miles distant and the wind was in our favor. Great viewing from the roof. The place is as eclectic as always. Very reasonable. Close to central square (1-1/2 blocks). Convenient to most everything else.',\n 'Greetings all!  Here it is in a nutshell.  Overpriced.  Room too small to accommodate a single persons luggage.  No place to hang clothes.  One spigot of cold water in the sink.  Spider on my towel, on removing it the rack fell to the floor.  Room  behind kitchen bad due to chatty cooks at 6 am.  Today second day, loud music at 6 am.  No rest for the weary.  Minimal breakfast offered so ate out.  Staff good!  For the money you can do much better!  Try Hotel San Jorge, cheaper, and much better.  Would not stay here again.  If not for lost luggage by United, delivered 44 hours after arrival, I would have moved. Mosquitoes in room.  No screens on window.',\n 'As you enter the courtyard, you are assailed by a collection of plants, pictures, memorabilia, and icons.  It is visually fascinating to walk around this hotel.  Antiques and oddities are perched harmoniously though the halls, up the stairs, and out to the roof top patio.  The communal kitchen is clean, and cozy.  The rooms were super quiet and spacious - and the restrooms were spotless with lovely hot water!  We had a small balcony where we could peek out at the stars...',\n \"I stayed there on December 27 and 28, 2013.  It's a very small hotel and that was one of the reasons we wanted to stayed there.  We were 30 of us so we rented the whole hotel , but when we got there they had only 5 out the 7 rooms reserved for us. We should of known then that it wasn't going to be a good experience.  The rooms were not what they said and advertise in the internet, one of the rooms had no running water so the bathroom was not working , none of the rooms had potable water other rooms had no tv in total they were not to the quality we were expecting.

Having a print out of my reservation that clearly stated my request and confirmation was useless. The restaurant is not very good.',\n \"Rooms are very clean but small, bathroom is split into three (shower, sink and WC) where a built in wardrobe would have been, making it impossible to have privacy. Bar next door hosts a karaoke night during the week, this continues until the early hours and with poor induration and no double glazing we were up till 1am. Pool doesn't have many loungers and can be very loud when families are around. Great view of the volcanos makes up for the 3 star review.\",\n \"We stayed here with two children aged 6 and 10, and we had a lovely time.  It's a small place and not overly luxurious, but the gardens are beautiful, the location is perfect, the staff was very helpful, and the room was very comfortable.  Breakfast by the pool with a view of the volcano in the background was a perfect way to start each day.  The pool is small and a little chilly, but the kids still enjoyed it.The shower wasn't great, either the water pressure or the drainage, but that wasn't a big deal.  The only real problem, as others have said, was the noise.  Weeknights were just fine, but the one weekend night we were there it was even worse than I had imagined, and we had a second floor room away from the street. We closed all our room windows, used our phones as white\",\n 'Excellent location and service overall.  I enjoyed the daily breakfast that was available when you wanted it.   Only downside is that the room itself lacked privacy (thin walls) and the church bells every morning (early) were a bit annoying.  It is a small price to pay for a great location.',\n \"We spent three nights here.  While it was okay, it was not what was promised in its write up.  If there was a gallery, it's long gone.  So is the wine tasting and sales and so is the breakfast, which is included, but served at a coffee shop three doors down.  The mattress was in need of  replacement, sheets and towels were clean and newer. One can see that at one time, it had a lot of promise but money or enthusiasm has waned in it's maintenance.\",\n \"I have stayed at this Hotel three times. Each time I was with a large group (18 people). The rooms were clean, everything was in walking distance and they were very friendly. I have thought about going to another Hotel when I return next year but I won't because I love this one.\",\n \"Very friendly staff that are knowledgeable of the area, and will help out with any questions you have. Rooms are barebones, which is perfect if you just need a place to clean up and sleep like I did. Right around the corner from central park and the market. The only real downside is a large group that came in and kept slamming their doors whenever they left. Some kind of door dampers installed would be a great way to cut out the noise from rowdier neighbors. Aside from that, I didn't hear any noise from the local clubs/parties going on.\",\n 'This hotel has a friendly staff who can help with your questions about getting around Antigua. This is a big plus if you are on your first trip to Antigua. It is very close to parque central and many other highly visited areas. We found the room to be basic and clean but very noisy.  This hotel is also used for a language school so there were many young people there.',\n 'We received a small room on the first floor with private bath. Pretty basic but nice enough. Rooms have a window facing the hall that let in all the outside noise. We were woken up multiple times by loud guests.

The hotel feels very secure and it in a good location - between the market and the main square, with many restaurants just around the corner. Fast wifi and a strong signal in the rooms. This is a good choice for couples looking for a nice place to crash in Antigua.',\n \"We were there last month and we thought its location was great. Just a short five minute walk from the Mercado de Artesanias and from the famous arch. The hotel itself is small. The rooms are of decent size. The bathrooms definitely need a little attention. They don't have a parking area, but they did recommend a parking area at another hotel that was also a short walk away.  The service was nice and friendly. We arrived late and went in and out a couple of times during the night and they were always ready to see if we needed any help.   Pros: Excellent location Friendly service Great wifi connection (better than other wifi connections in Guatemala)  Cons: Bathrooms No parking  I would stay here again :) \",\n 'We booked 5 out of the 8 rooms for our group and we had a blast! The staff is very nice and the rooms are adequate and very clean. The courtyard on ground floor served as our \"living room\". We would all sit down there and visit in the evenings and mornings. The had a refrig to store food in and we had use of a toaster oven and microwave oven. It was perfect for our group! Every morning the volcano had a different look and my daughter took a picture of it daily! We stayed upstairs and would leave our windows and door open to let the air flow through.',\n \"We stay only for 1 night and ran away from this bad place. The girl in the front desk promised us a hot water, but it wasn't right. The water was ice cold!! The room was dirty, the sheets and towels were stained and we had a huge spider in the room. Plus, it was noisy at night due to a bar next door. We had a terrible night and run away in the morning. For this amount of money (32$ per night and in weekend even More!!) you better looking for another place.\",\n 'We have enjoyed our visits lately to Hotel Posada San Vicente...good rates, clean rooms, hot showers and very close to all things good in town.  The roof deck provides a wonderful panoramic view of the city, especially at sunrise and sunset!!',\n 'We stayed 5 nights here. The rooms are quaint but the courtyard a bit noisy. The hotel hosted several large groups. My parents had to change rooms to accommodate other people. Their second bed was \"itchy\" but I hate to speculate why. Access to the kitchen was useful for leftovers. Terrace had great 360 views of the city and volcanos, including the very active El Fuego. ',\n \"We were disappointed with Posada San Vincente - for what we were paying we really expected much better.  Hot water was limited and not really ever properly hot. The courtyard is very noisy. Rooms are small and not well ventilated. There were two small soaps but the place doesn't even supply shampoo. We just felt like we were constantly getting ripped off by the place.  We booked the airport transfer and we drove around picking people up at their respective hotels and waiting for guests to arrive from other transfers for 1 hour and 15 minutes before we actually got on the road to the airport so make sure you leave a wide margin of time.  The wifi did work fine for us and the rooftop terrace is nice for the view.\",\n 'I spent a few nights at this hotel recently, and it was a perfect home base for our time in Antigua. It was a short walk to most of the main tourist sites and near a great grocery store. The hotels courtyard is truly lovely and brimming with healthy plants. Kudos to the gardener!  Our double room was on the 2nd floor, and it was simple and clean. Daily housekeeping did a great job. My favorite thing about this hotel is the rooftop terrace - The 360 views of the volcanoes are amazing. Agua, Fuego and Acatenango are easily visible (if the weather is clear) and there is a nice view of Saint Joseph Cathedral as well. A perfect spot to enjoy a relaxing afternoon break from exploring.   Everyone on staff was friendly and welcoming. The only criticism I have is that there was little',\n 'We visit the place a couple w 2 small kids. Arrived late. We asked before the hotel to stay on the ground floor. When we came at midnight with two sleeping kids from the airport. The guy insist to put us on 2nd floor. No elevator. He insist there is no room down. What was wrong. After I insist to be on the ground floor, as I ask few days before he gave us this small room.  I liked the yard and the location. Shower Ammm what to say. Funky head and not really hot. In general Beautiful small yard. Central place. The room very small. But clean. Most of the team lovey. Tv old style.  And can be noisy from the room around. ',\n 'It’s an ok hostel. It’s a little tired in places and sadly not the cleanest. I had to change beds as I woke up with bites after the first night.   The kitchen is alright and has pots and pans. Cutlery and plates are a little battered and the lack of good cleaning products means that people can’t / don’t really clean things thoroughly.   It has a good social vibe and nightly events. Good for tours and shuttles.   We stayed somewhere else on our way back through Antigua. ',\n \"I booked here specifically because I was told it was quiet. When I saw my room was far from the busy street noise outside I figured it would be a good nights sleep. Unfortunately the BLARING TV was on until 10:30pm then turned back on at 7AM. It was an exceptionally unpleasant way to wake up. When I went to complain at the front desk I saw there were actually 2 TV's on and no guests were present! I got the girl at reception to turn off 1, but she seemed like she could have cared less and went back to watching her show.  Then I go to order the free breakfast (burned pancakes, no butter, gross marmalade, ) & they have ....techno blaring in the garden. Sorry, but I paid extra to get a nice experience not to hear some random TV commercials and your terrible music. The room was fine.\",\n \"Nice place. Clean and very spacious. Comfortable beds, hot showers and free breakfast. Nice TV lounge and helpful staff. The dorms only have 6 beds in them and so are nice. Around are several stores for food and drink and restaurants. It is a 5 minute walk to the Central Park. It's about an easy 10 minute walk to the public bus park and market. Free WiFi. Thoroughly recommended.\",\n 'I have to be honest I was expecting a bit more based on the photos and description, but we still had a comfortable 2 night stay here. The photos must have been taken some time ago as the rooms are now a bit tired (dirty carpet, mould on walls and dead mosquitoes squashed on walls).  However, the courtyard is nice and they have a parrot by reception too! Nice location on a quiet street but only a 5 minute walk from the main square. Breakfast isn’t included though as it states on here, it is extra. Free coffee and drinking water was nice though! ',\n \"This is not a good choice.....i was put into a room next to a gate where they had ppl going back and forth with all kinds of equipment etc.   It was scary....also...the girl at the desk could not get off the cell phone to pay any attention to any guests.....just a crappy hotel....far from the center and has nothing to offer....at all.....don't bother folks.....you're better off in a hostel.....lol\",\n 'Lovely garden and roof terrace with a great view. Kind and friendly staff. Very good bed. The room gets cleaned every day. Not the best shower, but warm which was nice. Breakfast is okay. Location is great! ',\n 'We stayed here three nights in total. One night in the ground floor where the room was rather chilly and two nights on 1st floor which was much nicer. There is a lot of traffic noise. But the location is good and facilities good. The breakfast is excellent 30 Qz  ie £3 a eggs benedict with cheese and ham ,granola, yogurt, fresh fruit a roll and toast and unlimited coffee. For us the added bonus was the view of Volcano del Fuego emiting smoke and larva and Yolanda giving us a Spanish lesson . A good experience. ',\n 'There are loads of lovely alternatives so this is not somewhere you need to stay !    As with other reviews , the noise is unbelievable across the Central open  Courtyard !  The rooms are incredibly basic and bare light bulbs !   The staff are disinterested and unhelpful   There are so many nice places to stay in Antigua this is not one of them ! ',\n 'The exterior spaces are nice but the rooms are very basic and I’d struggle to say anything nice about them. It’s a little further out of the town so I’d say it’s better to spend a few extra dollars for a better location.',\n 'We stayed here for 4 nights in Dec 2017. Hotel staff friendly & welcoming, the staff spoke English & appreciated my efforts to speak Spanish! Hotel is in a quiet location but neat the main plaza, lovely courtyard. Breakfast served on the roof  terrace by attentive staff, breakfast was lovely. Fabulous views from roof terrace, especially when a volcano in the distance began to  emit smoke/ash...very exciting ! Rooms clean but fairly basic. Hot water does take a while to come through in the shower....so wait!! If needed, the hotel can arrange for your laundry to be done for you if you are there for a couple of days.',\n \"I just stayed one night.  The location is good - six blocks from the central plaza and very quiet.  The free breakfast is decent and the large courtyard is nice.  The showers are cold, however, despite having electric shower heads (I talked to others and they couldn't get hot water, either).  Antigua mornings can be chilly and a cold shower was not welcome! The workers were all very kind and helpful!\",\n 'We stayed 3 nights at Los Enquentros. We had the suite on the first floor with direct access onto the roof terrace. The ground floor rooms look a bit small and dark but are much cheaper. The decor is quirky and old fashioned but we had plenty of space and everything was clean and comfortable. The shower was hot as long as you turn it up very gently. I enjoyed sitting on the roof early in the morning and watching the birds visit with the volcanos in the background. Breakfast was nice and the owner, Irma, could not have been more helpful. The location is great, being just a few blocks from the Parque Central.',\n \"This place is definitely not ideal. It's very dirty, the sound proofing is extremely bad, and the lady's common areas are a hoarder's paradise. We were glad to get out of here. Only upside is that the lady is very nice and helpful. Still would not recommend it.\",\n \"We crashed here one night before leaving for the airport.  We go to Guatemala rather frequently and wanted to stay somewhere other than GC.  The manager lady (I don't remember her name) was fabulous.  She was up with us when we came in, and then up again when we left.  We were able to pay in American dollars, and we were able to include the cab ride to the airport the next morning.  (A tip- tell them your flight leaves 30 minutes before it actually does.  Our cab driver was at least a half hour late picking us up, and we had a nail biting drive to the airport.  Good thing the flight was delayed.)The hotel was sprawling with lots of courtyards and a rooftop terrace.  The rooms were good sized and clean.  Same with the bathroom.  The shower has that electric water heater that most\",\n 'I went to a wedding and a table collapsed on me full of glass vases. Could of got killed or maimed and no one from the staff apologized or did anything. They did send out a medic for the cut I had in my hand  and acted like it was my fault. I was just sitting there when it happened. Service was bad and you can hear the staff talking about you in Spanish. I would not recommend staying here.',\n 'I enjoyed my entire stay at this property.  It is located just a couple blocks away from everything we wanted to see.  I highly recommend room number 1.  It is 2 level room with plenty of hot water.  The front desk service was fast and courteous.  The breakfast is what you can expect from this type of hotel, and I have no complaints about it.  I will make this property my base every time I visit Antigua. If I have one complaint, it is the mattress.  Please upgrade your mattress quality, and I can rate this property higher.',\n \"Good hotel, great room, great location. The breakfast wasn't so good thought. the room was very private and clean. The service was good and it was a great way to start our traveling! we recommand on the upper level rooms.\",\n 'I went with my wife to this boutique hotel in Antigua Guatemala, and stay in the luxury suite that has a balcony. All the furniture were new and nice. The hotel has few rooms, so you felt that you are in your private mansion. Very quiet and romantic atmosphere. Walkable distance to major attractions in Antigua. Staff  helpful and friendly. ',\n \"We saw this hotel here and decided to visit to see if it was a place we'd like to stay another weekend. The employee who opened the door wouldn't let me in to check it out. Reservation only, he said. I said I only wanted to see the hotel and get pricing information, he said no and then opened the door so I could see the parking lot, but wouldn't let me enter. This was so insulting and outrageous.  We never will make a reservation now.\",\n \"It's a great hostel in Antigua if you're looking for a relaxed stay in a comfortable hostel in a great location (2 blocks from parque central). They're strict about noise after 9pm so it's not a party hostel. For partying we were able to go to other hostels just fine and come back to this hostel late at night so was perfect! Often had free coffee and water, and the wifi was good. Provided towels and had great showers and beds, as well as a kitchen available. Other guests were travellers too and met some great people. Would highly recommend!\",\n \"Stayed here one night, I must admit it was a random choice the night before leaving Guatemala, but totally fine. We had a private room with a clean shower, but very basic bathroom and signs everywhere reminding us of the different penalties we could experience if we left dirty towels, used both beds if we weren't 3 persons (one queen size and one single bed) - resulting in an additional charge on the bill, well, the list went on. Also, the doors weren't closed even if we locked them, they were easily pushed away and consecutively open.  They offer a 24h open reception with snacks and beverages. \",\n \"Nice and clean. Cheap and cheerful. Good location, close to centre, but on a quiet street. Hot showers pretty good.   The only downside is the rooms aren't very soundproof, you can hear people/cleaners on rooftop terrace moving furniture around.   \",\n \"This place isn't great, the staff is pretty rude and there are 100 rules unnecessary posted everywhere. The terrace closes early so you can't hang out anywhere. We wanted to switch the night we stayed to do the volcano with a friend and she said no then asked the next day if we were doing it that day (obviously it was too late). Also strick rule about only being allowed to use the bathroom in your dorm which is tiny and awkward if you have to use the washroom as a female. \",\n 'Overall good hotel. All staff were super cordial and attentive. We got a room with a window on a main street so sleeping on a Friday night was challenging. We requested to be moved to a different room and the experience was way better. Nice hotel',\n \"The hotel is beautiful, clean and well maintained, and the staff is good.  Our room was beautiful, airy and spacious, with an ingenious separation of toilet, shower and sink that worked well.  Gorgeous flowering plants are everywhere and well maintained, and the pool is sparking and warm.  There is coffee, tea and water available.  Wi-fi is a strong signal. The ONLY downside is the bar next door.  We didn't have trouble sleeping, but you need to be able to sleep through a heavy bass beat and bar noise that lasts from 7 pm until 1 am.  We accepted this as the trade-off for the excellent location.  You are a well-lit half block from the central square, so safe for going to restaurants and shops at night.\",\n \"Casa del Parque was just OK...the rooms had a musty smell because there is no proper ventilation in the bathroom (which was small).  The room was spacious but hot with only one fan in the room (a lot of the hotels don't have air conditioning). It's a great location but can be pretty loud because it's close to bars, but that can be a good thing if you plan to consume a lot of alcohol...you won't have far to walk.   Overall, Antigua is a great city and when I return I'll definitely stay at another hotel that's a little more upscale and offers breakfast and has a larger pool. \",\n 'Great location, lovely and courteous staff! We stayed in room #2 which had a nice view of the church across the street, a little drafty but nice decor. The place was over all very quiet, probably because we stayed during low season. A bit expensive considering all the accommodation options in Antigua though!',\n 'I have stayed at Palacio Chico several times with mission team groups. It gets us an evening where we can tour the markets, and is very close to several places to eat. They are very accomodating to let us double or triple up. The facility is clean, quiet, and the staff always helpful.   Las Torches across the street is a good restaurant, with easy walking to Palacio Chico. Pricey wine, but the food is fairly priced for the area.',\n 'This hotel was centrally located to great restaurants, central park. The room we had #6 was fabulous! Beautiful decor, nice touches, etc. the staff was helpful and courteous.The patio/garden was lovely w/parakeets that kept you company while you had a simple breakfast that was included w/ the room. I will most definitely go back! Rach',\n 'The hotel is near to the central park. It has a great service and the employees always are attentive. The price is ok according to the quality. I recommend to travel to Antigua, Guatemala and to this hotel.',\n 'We (couple, 40 & 50 years old) stayed at Posada Don Valentino for one night in November 2013 and paid about $40 a night.  Our room was small but clean.  The bathroom was also small but clean; the water was hot.  There was a room safe and cable television.  The hotel is quiet and has a kitchen and salon.  It is about four blocks from Parque Central and one block from the market.  We stayed in four Antigua hotels over five nights and this was the best one for the price.',\n \"This place is run-down, dirty in places, and it's apparent that the ownership lacks the incentive to invest in new things to update an old property.  In our first room, both the TV and shower were broken.  They brought in old sets until one barely worked.    The worst part is that we requested the wake-up call for a morning shuttle to the airport 3 times, because they seemed arrogant and confused.  They didn't wake-us up!  This is the first time this has ever happened to me.  When I told the front office person, she told me to write complaint forms and it wasn't her fault because it was in a book that she showed me.  She did seem upset, but this is a process that should work within any hotel.    On a minor note, the rooms are over-priced for what you get by Antigua standards. \",\n 'Great location right near la Merced church which was the centre for many of the Easter festivities over semana Santa which was just amazing. Small and intimate hotel, made friends easily with the other guests. The staff were very helpful, overall enjoyed my stay. ',\n \"I stayed 1 night on my way back to Guatemala City, the room was comfortable and clean and I was lucky enough to have a room with a view of the rooftops.  There are only 9 rooms or so and it looks like most of them don't have any natural light as they look onto an internal courtyard and stairwell.  The lone guy working on reception was very good, despite his lack of English he was really helpful.\",\n 'We just stayed in Posada San Vincente for 1 night on our way between Guatemala City and Lago Atitlan. We arrived pretty late but they were great. Got us checked in quickly. Room was basic, but clean and had everything we needed. Quiet too! In the morning we spent some time on the rooftop patio, which is gorgeous. Would be a great place to chill in the daytime. Free coffee, tea and water available, and good internet access.   They also arranged our airport pickup from Guatemala City - everything went smoothly.',\n 'The hotel is pretty, very centrally located,  and the roof terrace was nice for reading.  Staff seemed fine and we were able to store our bags after checking out.   Room was big - we had a single and double bed - and free reliable wifi.  However,  our shower was terrible and flooded our room. Our room was close to what I think was a staff room, and staff were very loud during the day and early in the morning. Also, there were quite a few children playing outside our room throughout our stay.   It was fine,  but we stayed in nicer and cheaper hotels in Antigua.  ',\n 'Close to the central square in the old town, nice garden area on the ground floor and a roof top patio area where you can relax. We were able to leave our big bags here as we moved around on excursions. Kitchen available for shared use. Travel agent next door and a supermarket 1 and a half blocks away at 5a Calle Poniente.',\n 'Pros Friendly staff Easy check in Clean room Safe  Laundry service  Charming  Good location  Secure at night  Roof top   Cons Very very noisy court yard  Small rooms Hot water in shower inconsistent (only mentioning because it can get quite cold in Antigua). ',\n 'We started our holiday at hotel Posada san vincente. A great place, clean rooms and helpful staff.   The rooms are a bit noisy. But the location (close to the central parc) and the lovely courtyard makes up for it.',\n \"Great front staff-helpful for setting up excursions/transportation.   Front staff spoke Engliish during the day.  The door was locked at night and you had to knock to get in.  Room clean.  Clean water for drinking and filling water bottles.  Perfect location.  No AC but didn't need.  Great views on balcony.  There is a rooster close by, so can be a little noisy.\",\n \"Stayed here with a group of 10 for one night before heading out to the airport in Guatemala City. The price was great and the staff was friendly and helpful but it's definitely a no-frills kind of place. The shower in one of our rooms was broken, but quickly repaired, though water pressure was still pretty awful. We were on the first floor and it was very noisy at night; not sure if it was staff, fellow guests or street noise. Staff helped us arrange very affordable airport transportation and the free WiFi was pretty strong for Guatemala. It's a good, safe place for a quick stay for those on a budget, but for ~$15 more per night per person, there are much nicer options in Antigua.\",\n 'Room was small.  Bathroom small.  Sparce.  Reasonably clean.  Rock hard mattresses and pillows.  Some of the staff remarkably reserved, almost surly.  Others very friendly.  (These people see a lot of difficult foreigners and could easily get jaded.)  We came to Antigua from a week in a rental house at Atitlan.  The return to one small hotel room could bias my perception of it.  It was not anything special for the price we paid.  We had reserved ahead of time because I had my wife and two youngest daughters and did not want to be looking for a place with them in tow.  I am sure we could have secured a much better price if we had negotiated it upon arrival.',\n \"Staff is very friendly and helpful. Wifi works well.  My friends first floor room intensly smelled like moth balls. Since there is only a small window facing the interior patio, the smell cannot be eliminated. Yikes. I stayed on the 2nd Floor and the smell was not so detectable.  Any noise echoes in the interior of the hotel, so be aware. It's like that in most colonial hotels. I found it a bad value for the money $35/night. No coffee or food available. There are better alternatives in Antigua for less money, like the Juma Ocag, a lovely place.\",\n 'Clean, spacious rooms. Friendly staff. Just two blocks form the plaza (center of town). Although there is no noise isolation, it is rather quite at night, which means a night good sleep. Kitchenette available.',\n 'I stayed at a few hostels in Antigua and this is fine the main issue of noise from the courtyard. 3 people talking sounds like a party in the room! The breakfast is okay just a bit slow. The wifi could be improved as well',\n 'The hostel staff are great and are always willing to help with requests, booking tours and shuttles etc. I would strongly recommend that you book the Acatenango hike through the hostel as it is proved to be professionally done. There is free water and coffee 24/7 and a nice few communal areas as well as a fully functioning kitchen and bar. The rooms are large and have plenty of storage space and the beds all have an individual light and are comfortable.',\n \"We had a pleasant stay here because of the following: Very comfortable beds and good night's sleep. Attractive communal areas including a pretty garden. Good breakfast included that you can enjoy every morning in said garden. Generally happy and pleasant staff. Good security measures with the front entrance having a friendly young lad on the door evenings/early mornings. Erm... Guess that's it... Quite a few good things though, eh?\",\n 'This is a basic clean hostel with shared bathrooms. Our room was a basic room which was clean and comfortable.There was a reasonable breakfast and a nice garden to eat breakfast. The location was very good and it had  good wifi. There is good night security. Shop around for travel deals and laundry as they are slightly more expensive than other places nearby.',\n \"on first look Jacaranda doesnt look like much as the rooms are quite basic. but the place is really clean - there were always cleaners around- and the price is great especially when you consider that a freshly made breakfast is included. its also got very good security throughout the night which is important in Antigua. the showers take a while to heat up but if you persevere you can get hot water! its good for couples or people travelling not looking to socialise, although if you're looking for a hostel vibe i wouldn't recommend it.\",\n 'I was a bit late in organising accom for my arrival in Guatemala so was going in blind. However, I have no regrets.  Lucy on front desk is great with perfect English. The hostel is clean and basic and seems to attract a very chilled vibe as opposed to other more party hostels.  Breakfast is great also.',\n 'I stayed a couple of nights in this hostel at the beginning of my trip in Guatemala, and decided to stop there again before leaving the country. It is a quiet place and the staff was always very nice and helpful. I had a small single room (maybe the illumination can be improved) and the shared bathroom was clean and comfortable. In the morning you can choose among a few types of breakfast, which was good. There is a nice garden in the back of the hostel.',\n 'Lovely courtyard where you can relax have a drink and sit in the sun. Rooms fairly basic but nice enough. Hot water nice views from rooftop. Pretty decor resembling some spanish heritage. Rooms large. Only annoying thing is that you have to knock or rung the bell whenever you want to get into the hotel which means we were woken up late and early as you can hear it in your room.pick a room on a higher floor on the other side of the courtyard ',\n 'I stayed here recently for a few nights. The location is good, just four blocks away from the main plaza. The courtyard area and rooftop are nice and the rooms were spacious and clean. You need to leave the shower running for a good five minutes before it starts to warm up though! The breakfasts were nice and reasonably priced. Staff were also friendly but didn’t understand much English. WiFi worked quite well. Overall decent enough hotel.',\n 'Quiet hotel, with very nice accomodation! People is very knid and always willing to satisfy the client. Breakfast on the roof is very good, with an excellent view on the city and mountains! However, bad smell in the bathroom (but which can be easily fixed)',\n 'This place looks not much from the outside, but when you enter it has a beautiful centre courtyard.  All the rooms come off the centre, it can be noisy if there are people in the courtyard as the noise travels upwards.  If you have room backing onto the road, this can too be noisy with local traffic on the cobbled roads.  Breakfast is on the roof with a great view to volcanoes, which you can see them puffing smoke.  Close location to the centre of town, with good restaurants also close by.',\n 'This hotel is located an easy 10 minute walk from the city center which makes it a nice quiet place from traffic. The view from the roof of the hotel where you have breakfast is fantastic. You can choose from a menu which free breakfast you would like. I ordered pancakes one morning that came with 2 pancakes, 3 different fruit slices, yogurt and granola, it was fantastic!  The staff are very pleasant and helpful, most also speak excellent English especially the desk staff.  I agree with other reviewers regarding hearing everything in your room so if guests are holding conversations at 3 in the morning as they are leaving you can hear everything. You would think that the guests themselves would understand the need to be quiet when they are in the courtyard at night.',\n \"Stayed here to attend a friend's wedding in a chapel in town.

The staff was very nice and attentive and Antigua is simply beautiful.\",\n 'i recently lead a group of 13 to Antigua and Panajachel. the tour company booked us into this hotel. it was very convenient - 2 blocks from Plaza Central w/ several restaurants and small cafes nearby. the interior of the hotel is like an antique store - all sorts of older chairs, telephones, furniture, typewriters here and there. rooms ranged from small [one queen bed w/ two armoires and desk] to spacious [two queen beds, etc]. wifi was available at no charge - good signal. Luis and staff were excellent - friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. no breakfasts but two small cafes nearby.  if you can deal w/ an older place but great staff, San Sebastian is a great choice.',\n 'The grounds are spectacular. I loved the energy of the property. Overall the staff was quite accommodating. Make sure that when you are booking a room that you specify which room type you are requesting. The food was very good. I wish there were more choices for gluten free. ',\n 'Tiny and old rooms (we booked a double room). Almost no light, just like a cave. However the room was clean. The bed was not good so it was difficult to rest properly. On the other side the bathroom was good comparing to the room itself.  No breakfast included and there is no restaurant in the hostal. Anyway there is a kitchen for the guests.  Location was good, few steps from the Parque Central. We booked private shuttle from the airport. They charge an additional fee of Q50 per every hour your flight is delayed. They warn about that when you book the shuttle and it is supposed to pay the additional hour of parking in the airport. Once we took the shuttle we didnt see the driver paying anything and passing any parking barrier, so I wonder if those 50Q are really a fraud. Just',\n \"First things first: the dorms have no supporting furniture whatsoever, just the tiny locker... there is no space for nothing, all is crammed... we are talking about twelve persons and all their personal belongings. A mess.   The bathroom is cleaned once a day, not enough, again, when we are talking about 12 persons using it... when I arrived, just before cleaning, the rubbish bin was full - not a nice thing to see or smell - and on top of that there was no toilette paper (fortunately I noticed that in advance).  Common space is limited to a sterile rooftop with three tables and two sunbeds. Kitchen is also in the rooftop. Now imagine... it's raining or windy and cold... no place to be except in the awfully crowded and messy dorm. And access to the  kitchen will be for the braves\",\n 'We spent a weekend in Antigua, and this hotel was very good.  I have stayed in Antigua several times before and this is the closest I have stayed to the central plaza, and is very convenient if you are traveling alone is safe to walk at any time to the plaza and then come back.  The staff was outstanding, so kind and helpful and the hotel had a nice pool and good rooms.  I liked it a lot.  The price was also very reasonable.',\n 'I stayed here in May with a group volunteering with Safe Passage. I was very happy with my second floor room (#7) and even though there is a loud bar next door I was able to muffle the noise with the room fan and my white noise machine. The room was cleaned promptly and well each day and staff were polite, even when - due to a reservation glitch - we needed to be moved out of the hotel a day early. Staff helped me move my luggage to a sister property down the street. Breakfast was good also.',\n \"If you want to spend some time like if you were at some relative's home, to feel yourself welcome and well attended in a cozy ambiance, this is the place. My family and I have spent some quality moments there, and we have nothing to regret. The owners will treat you like you would treat an old friend. You can enjoy the silence of the country if you want to rest and if you want to go to a bar or a restaurant and socialize with others, within a few minutes you can get to Antigua. Hope to get back soon.\",\n \"After a few nights' stay at El Hostal earlier in our trip, we were really happy we decided to try Posada Don Valentino for our 2nd stage in Antigua. There's a lot more happening at this end of town, more places to eat, it's close to the parque central (central park). Plus the posada is very quiet, offering an excellent night's stay. The staff were very friendly and polite.   The only two minor issues were with the water (somewhat difficult to regulate the shower temperature, although we had the same issue at most of the places we stayed, but for this slightly pricier place, we expected a bit better) and the two rooms we got were rather dark (however, this seems to be typical in Antigua and indeed throughout Guatemala).  Note that a pool is advertised but it's in another property\",\n \"I have made the Don Valentino my home in Antigua on 3 occasions, one was for a week, Other stops were for 2 days. Many positives: English speaking staff, all lovely ladies. The location is the best: Out the door, turn right, for a large grocery, just doors away. Another block to the big market.    A short walk the other way to an ATM, the Central Park, and a place we love for morning coffee, The Bagel Barn, a big gringo gathering spot because of good wifi. A block from the Park is Mono Loco, another gringo favorite because you can watch any sporting event. If it's televised anywhere they have it.   Across the street from the Don Valentino is one of my favorite restaurants, La Pena de Sol Latino. Great food, reasonable prices. The owner is an ex pat from Nashville.      The hotel\",\n \"We didn't stay here but stopped here a couple of times -- first, for directions, and second, because the staff were so helpful and friendly and we used the internet service, and had tea and coffee.

All have been pleasant or at least adventurous.  In fact...I need to write reviews for all of my positive stays.  This hotel made me sad.  They hotel took my request for a room.  I confirmed.  Three days later I received an email saying they were sorry but they had given my room to a larger group.  Interesting.  I guess I expected something more then an excuse from them but in the end that is what I got.  I was never offered a real apology just',\n 'The friendly lady at the reception ensures that the guests are comfortable: from breakfast till organizing tours and farewell.

It is perfect for a quick weekend trip, but I would not recommend for extended stays.  There is nothing special about the rooms and all.',\n 'I totally enjoyed my stay at Posada Dona Luisa. Reasonable rates, clean nice rooms good view of the volcano...Couple blocks from the main square.The hotel is safe and has locked doors at all times.  The shower needs a facelift for sure.

Cramped quarters, clean, sheets and fresh coffee, INSTANT in a land known for his roasting and grinding..it´s good for those seeking adventure.  A bummer you have to pay $7.50 USD a night to park your car 3 blocks away. It is less than 4 blocks to the big center of town where the Indian venders come to see you everything, including cell phones they stole from someone the day before.',\n 'We had a great stay here and at 3 other hotels under the same chain (long story). At each place, we negotiated a rate of 25 a night which didnt include breakfadt but gave us access to good clean kitchens, wifi (except on hotel) and very lovely staff.

Other than that, I would recommend!',\n \"Their customer service is really really bad. Unfriendly and seemingly uninterested to make their customers happy. The beautiful yard is sprayed with pesticides which stinks for hours (even smelled it the next day...)  They made a mistake with our booking and skipped a day (so they wanted us to leave for one night and return the next day). We wanted our money back instead as we didn't want to move every day. but for over 1 hour they refused to do so.

We will not.\",\n \"This place has horrendous customer service, old mattress that you can feel all of the springs in, it is super loud and the workers wake you up first thing in the morning as their chatter echoes through the whole hotel.

',\n 'My stay at three monkeys was okay, but I would not stay here again. On a positive note it’s in an excellent location, very close to many restaurants and bars, the people staying and working there were great, and the onsite bar was cheap! So if you love to party it’s a good place to stay.  However the beds are uncomfortable and have bed bugs, the showers only have hot water at a pressure so low it’s like a sad trickle of a bucket, and the tours booked through the hostel were sub-par. The hostel tours consistently ran 30mins - 1 hour late and crammed so many people onto a bus it was like a chicken bus for tourists. There are heaps of tour companies around Antigua so I would recommend shopping around.',\n 'A cool little hostel in a good location. Aesthetically ticks the box, cute garden area, hammocks, cool lighting.

The garden is an amazing place to just sit read a book and relax! One of the best thing about this place was the included breakfast and the kitchen they have for the guests!

The staff was always willing to help with a smile and kindness!

It was very dark everywhere and annoying western music. But then I saw the garden in the back, the clean and comfortable bathroom and my private room was nice as well, so at the end it was good.

Sunny rooms along tiled walkways surround lush garden with plashing fountain (muted at night). Great deal! I stayed 16 days, each morning checking out the weather & taking in views of Vulcán de Agua and puffing Volcán de Fuego from the rooftop terrace. Complimentary coffee & drinking water. Optional breakfast was decent, served alfresco & only a little more than you'd pay in a typical cafe. Abundant in-room storage.\",\n 'The staff at this hotel are extremely pleasant and courteous.  They do speak enough English to communicate.   The rooftop terrace is excellent for viewing the volcano and nearby hills over the town.  The grounds are well kept with nice flowers and landscaping.   We enjoyed the walk to parqué central just 4 blocks away.  We will not stay here again due to a small number of mosquitos in the room and the head-ache-inducing odour of insecticides on about half of the property.  We were pleased however that our room was changed to a less smelly insecticide room.  Finally,  they told us they would accept Quetzals or US cash.  We tried to pay with $100 US.  Staff said they could not do so because they did not have enough change in Quetzals or USD$.  Rate was 7.5 to 1 if they had.  Later',\n \"This hotel would be so nice, if it weren't so noisy.

There is also a lovely roof top terrace from where you can enjoy the views of the lava on the active volcano nearby Antigua.\",\n \"Pros: Beautiful courtyard, nice rooftop for breakfast, and clean well decorated rooms with A/C. 5-10 minute walk from centre of town. Cons: The front door to the building is always locked so you have to press the buzzer and wait for the staff to let you in every time you enter the hotel. At least they are there to open the door 24/7. Can't comment on price because went here as part of a tour package.\",\n 'The hotel itself is beautiful as the courtyard is covered in beautiful plants.

From there, through an inconspicuous door, you reach a wonderful patio and the newer part of the hotel.

There were two electrical outlets in the room. One was hanging out of the wall, and shorted. The other, stuck in the closet. Nothing near the bed or desk.

A friend staying closer to the front complained of music all night and a fighting couple next door that he could hear every word. The bed linens look a bit past it and the mattresses are firm, but OK.  The showers are cold water with a little electric heater attached to the spout.

There is free wifi but it doesn't work in all the rooms (not in ours too far from the router I guess). There is also a good and cheap laundry service.  The hotel is quiet at night and clean.

The hotel is an extra 5 minutes walk from the main square compared to other places but unless you're a particularly lazy person I don't think this is an issue. The setting is nice, it's a set of rooms surrounding a grass courtyard with a fountain. You share the space with the family so it's more of a B&B than a hotel. The owner speaks perfect English (she used to teach it as a foreign language) and is very helpful with planning your days. We were studying Spanish while in the city so she kindly gave us a little 5 minute lesson as she provided us breakfast.   This didn't bother us but it should be noted that this is NOT a party hotel.

So I suppose all their guests come from word of mouth and repeat customers.  I was surprised to see them here on Tripadvisor (and it is a new listing).

The only downfall was it faces the street so you can here people coming and going at night, plus there was a putrid smell that came from the drains in the bathroom at night.

Our stay was broken up with one night here before leaving for a homestay elsewhere, then returning for another 2 nights which was also the end of my trip in Central America.  First of all, this accommodation is more like a homestay but without interaction or meals from the hosts. The rooms are located in a large house and the family live within a gated section of this property. Each room is fitted out differently, some rooms better then others.

There is a pretty courtyard and a roof terrace that has nice views. There is coffee and drinking water available. The location is very good. They exchange USD at a very competitive rate. On the downside: some of the rooms can be a little cramped, so ask to see a selection before you choose. There is no breakfast available.',\n \"Stayed here in August 2006 with a grad school group. Less than 15 rooms. Locked gate so you feel safe and can sleep with your bedroom window wide open at night if you want. Beautiful fountain, roses and flowers are in the center of the hotel grounds.

Close walk to center of town.\",\n \"We stayed here for three nights while in Antigua. The staff is wonderful, the garden beautiful,and the free breakfast is great, especially the yogurt and granola! What we enjoyed most was the quiet...it's hard to find such a peaceful place at reasonable prices. The rooms are a bit small, but who comes to Antigua to stay in the hotel room?  Only one request -  PLEASE buy a bigger cage for your beautiful parrot.  He needs room to move around!!\",\n \"This hotel is very home like. The grounds are surrounded by beautiful gardens and a friendly parakeet. The staff is fantastic, friendly and super hospitable. The room is fairly basic but you really wouldn't stay at a place like this for the rooms but rather the experience. Muy excelente. It is also conveniently located in Antigua's main square.\",\n 'This hotel is a good bet if you enjoy birds, a restful fountain and flower gardens.  The staff and owners are friendly and quite helpful.  We used the hotel as our location from which we explored Guatemala returning twice, during a 4 week trip, to recharge our energy.          The included breakfast was near perfect, as it was the same as I prepare for myself in Canada, yogurt, fruit, toast, strawberry jam, coffee and juice.  Rooms are clean and neat but carpeted.  I prefer tile floors rather than a wall to wall carpet, as carpets tend to wear and loose their appeal detracting from the accommodation.  The original paintings hung on the walls are really quit nice.  Third world countries can be trying if you must have a hot shower rather than a warm one everyday.  It was a throw',\n 'They are predatory and do no know what the website that does the booking says.  I had to cancel a day after the reservation and they charged me the full room price.

They are liars and will take your money and laugh.  do not use this hotel.',\n 'We were in Don Valentino for one week in July 2010. The place is perfect everything is in the near: central park, bus station, open market, restaurants, market. The staff is helpful. The room was OK - hot water.',\n 'This beautiful little hotel in the heart of Antigua was perfect for my solo stay.  The courtyard can get a little loud during breakfast but was very quiet otherwise.  I cannot say enough about the staff - they were so helpful and happy to answer any of my questions.  The breakfasts, infused water all day, and coffee in the evenings were all lovely.  Highly recommended!',\n \"This really is quite an ancient building ! It has a lovely courtyard which the rooms look into, so there are no views at all.  And you will to keep your curtains closed if you want any privacy.   The furniture is rustic, and a bit musty, but I guess it's part of the charm.  There is a lovely room terrace where you can see views of the city.   Breakfast was included in our stay, but by the time we got there, either there wasn't much left or it's not a big deal.  Who knows.   Our visit was however ruined by a family with small children who just screened all the time, it was impossible to escape the noise.  The rooms are very close to each other, you can literally everything. \",\n \"I have stayed in Hotel Meson de Maria on several occasions and recommend it to friends who travel to Antigua. It provides a lovely colonial setting in a small boutique hotel with thoughtful touches--reproductions of colonial art in the rooms, a plant-filled patio and balconies off some of the rooms where one can eat, drink, or chat. It is only a couple of blocks from the center of town, a very easy walk, but it is quiet and an oasis off the streets. It's also a good value! My only small quibble--the included breakfast is a little meh. But just go across or down the street to eat if you want something more!\",\n \"Hostal Antigua was just okay. The dorms were very reasonably priced...I think I paid less than $8 for a four-bed room. I was alone the whole time, but the rooms are tiny; if there had been other people, it would have been uncomfortably crowded. The rooms are VERY dark--there is a small window, but it's high on the ceiling and faces the hallway, so it doesn't let in much light.   The terrace is not pretty, but it has lots of power outlets, which is nice. The wifi is fast and reliable, both in the rooms and on the terrace.

The kitchen is very, very good. And the girl that works in the reception is very nice and helpful. They have good prices for antigua. It was quiet when iI was there but it was good.

The rooms and bathrooms were spotless - very clean.  Beautiful views of the volcano and town from their rooftop terrace.  The rooftop terrace was my favorite spot while staying there.  I was initially concerned that the rooms did not have Air Conditioning, however, we did not need it.  The rooms were comfortable and we even had to use a warm blanket at night (in August).

The rooms are clean and basic and warm enough. It was great to enjoy a hot shower and there are televisions in the rooms.  The wifi is generally good downstairs but a bit temperamental upstairs.

However, the location is good and everything is within walking distance. Would be happy to go back',\n 'The room where we stayed at was close to the street and you could hear the cars passing by, it was loud.  The beds in the room were comfortable, however there were hairs in one of them. We took them out but that wasn\\'t nice.

If you\\'re traveling in a car there isn\\'t parking so you need to park in a street next to the suites and you have to pay Q50 for a guy to come and \"watch\" the car, during the night I went to check the car 2 times and never saw that guy. The hotel isn\\'t finished yet so you can\\'t have breakfast there. The rooms are spacious and comfortable to spend a couple of nights, you have hot water and a private bathroom which is always good.  ',\n \"Stayed here on 2 occasions. We stayed in different rooms, one on the first floor and again on the second floor. Seems to be OK for a budget/short stay. Very pretty inside the courtyard but all noise echoes through to the rooms. Not sure what it is about the beds but they seem to squeak which makes for a noisy sleep. There's somebody on reception most times of the day & night which was helpful. However one night we had to ask the reception staff to keep the noise down at 1am in the morning, they were chatting & playong music quite loudly.\",\n \"Frankly I felt that this place had opened before it was ready.  Complete lack of signage making it a stealth hostel, the first room i was assigned the handle came off in my hand, the second had a TV with no remote placed 9 feet up on the wall so as to be unusable. Bathroom was functional and there was hot water, so it's not a complete disaster, but I was pretty unimpressed.\",\n 'The luscious tropical courtyards are tranquil and filled with interesting and well tended plant life. This is a true oasis that boasts art and delicious food as well.  We went for a jacuzzi room upgrade and we wouldn’t repeat the floor level tub, but we did love the private balcony, fireplace and cathedral ceiling.  It should be 5 stars but 1 hand towel, no wash cloths and a slow draining sink 2 days after reporting  it keeps it from the rating it should have in every other respect.',\n \"I enjoyed my night at San Jorge Hotel.  I had just 24 hrs to visit Antigua and wanted a quick overnight getaway.  I decided to stay a few blocks away from the main square ... quiet and convenient.  The hotel is very comfortable and clean. I stayed in a double room with two large beds, a bathroom with full bath, TV with cable, closet, fireplace, etc. The garden is beautiful and there's a very picturesque view of the volcano behind the hotel.

We were coming from a much fancier hotel, so we were prepared for something pretty basic. Staff warned us beforehand that our room was very small and dark, but it was actually quite adequate.  Furnishings were attractive and though the room was very tiny, it was clean and functional.  Our ensuite bathroom was simple and basic (toilet, sink and very weak shower) but clean and adequate.  There was no tv, but you could see where there used to be one mounted on the ceiling! We didn't care about a tv, but I guess some people might.

Actually they did charge me for 4 nights claiming there was confusion because I had cancelled a prior reservation and rebooked. They actually said I reserved and cancelled twice. Either way they admitted there was only one reservation in the end, so still don't understand why they would charge me for 4 nights and not say anything, especially when I asked the night prior to early checkout if everything was OK. The clerk was very condescending and refused to refund me in full the extra amount. Ended up having to dispute with my credit card company when I returned home. So beware! Otherwise location and common areas are good, breakfast average and my room was dark and had a musty smell. I woul not stay here again if it\",\n \"My girlfriend and I stayed in Room #1 for 3 nights. The hotel is beautiful. The staff is friendly and bilingual. The free breakfast is also pretty good. Unfortunately, our experience was less than satisfactory.   We were woken up each of the 3 mornings between 6:30-7:30am to extremely loud sounds coming from the second floor. Above our room is the terrace. Each morning it sounded like furniture being moved. The noise lasted 20-40 minutes and it was LOUD.  It made it impossible to sleep, even over our two bedroom fan phone apps. We complained to the receptionist the second morning, but it didn't help.

There was some damp on the walls but the water was hot and constant.  Both the hostel and the room were safe and clean. Good security and constantly-cleaning housekeeping staff. All of the staff are friendly but mostly keep to themselves.   The room I had was a good size and although I was told I had a brand new bed it was one of the most uncomfortable beds I have slept on.

Clean, well equipped kitchen and free water. Close to the centre and several restaurants.

Once inside the rooms there is no noise so a quiet sleep can be had.  The rooms are clean however lack ventilation and suffer from mild damp issues so they may seem a little musty....we overcome this by sleeping with window open and the fan on.  The kitchen is well equipped and very clean with a lovely roof trace next to it....a great place to chill on the sun loungers in the afternoon heat.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  They also give free drinking water, tea and coffee.  Lovely little getaway.',\n 'An okay place to stay in fairly expensive Antigua.

The location is great -- about 2 blocks from the main square, and just around the corner from Dona Luisa's bakery, a terrific bakery and restaurant.  The owner Luis was very helpful and we even had use of the kitchen.  Each room was like a museum, with ornate furniture and decorations.  The rooftop terrace gave us 360 degree views of Antigua.  This isn't a luxury hotel, it is wonderful and funky and we felt safe and comfortable here.\",\n 'So pretty place. Fantastic furniture, enviroment. Our room was wide, with a private bathroom. Big jacuzzi, hot water (rare in Guatemala). The best memory i bring with my self is the polite and kindness of Luis, the owner.

Luis--who I think is the owner--is a warm and welcoming man. He truly tries to make guests feel at home here.

The whole place was thoroughly cleaned and inspected every day.',\n 'The hotel has a green, welcoming yard but the rooms are dark and the whole place is pretty noisy, due to the thin windows (you can NOT actually close them entirely) and the owner s family who wakes up at 5:30 AM every morning.

Still it´s a clean, convenient place to stay.',\n 'We really enjoyed our stay here.  The location is fantastic for the price.  The roof top has a beautiful view of the volcanoes and sunset.  The rooms are basic, but good for the location.  The staff mainly speaks spanish, so not as helpful as I would have liked when recommending a restaurant.  My only major complaint is the shuttle company that they arranged our transportation through from Antigua to Pana.  The driver was pretty rude and he dropped us off far from the public pier and lead us into the hands of \"helpful\" boat drivers, who took us and our luggage to a private dock and attempted to have us pay 20-30 dollars for a ride to santa cruz, instead of 2.50.  We figured this out and lugged our bags to the public dock.  It was a very uncomfortable and unpleasant situation. ',\n \"We stayed here with our two young children.

Hotel staff was very accommodating to configure the rooms to fit our multiple family groups.  The property has lots of charm as all rooms open to a courtyard with lots of greenery and a fountain.

Like all of Antigua, it looks like a fortress from the outside, but the door opens to a lovely garden and fountain-a welcomed respite from the cobblestones and pollution of the city.  The complementary breakfast is fresh and more than adequate to get you on your way. The garden is a nice spot to read or catch some sun. The safe was not working in the first room I was assigned to, so I was switched to another, which was roomy and adequate. My only complaint was no hot water on the 3rd morning of my stay.

Otherwise, comfortable room, bathroom and shower, nice living area and beautiful views.\",\n \"This hostal was clean, had friendly staff and the free purified water had a nice touch to the atmosphere.

It was a lovely room, big and spacious with 3 queen beds.  The room had lots of character and room for luggage etc.  The lobby area had lots of antiques and artifacts to look at.  The hotel is quite central and easy to walk to the Central Park and markets.  The owner was very friendly and helpful.  It's a shame I couldn't find the artifacts I was looking for to add to my own collection :(  You will love Antigua and be sure to shop till you drop !\",\n 'Listed up as ‘Top choice’ in Lonely Planet, but it’s like going back in time. Old rooms, poorly decorated, not clean,… Bathrooms are cleaned one time a day and there enough for the amount of guests they have. For breakfast you can choose from 5 menu’s. Rather simple, if you compare to Yellow House, 10 meters further in the street.  Though, friendly & helpful receptionists. After one night, we went to another hotel as it wasn’t really worth the money.',\n 'By Guatemalan standards it is worth 4 stars, by US standards 3.  But it is nice and clean, has a, friendly and capable staff, offers dorm rooms, singles and doubles with private baths.  A rooftop patio is a delightful spot to relax.  Nice decor too.  Two blocks from the central plaza.  Wi-fi plus a computer in the officina.  Good value for Antigua.  I would stay here again.',\n \"This is not a party hostel which is ideal if you're just passing through Antigua with a shuttle to somewhere else early in the morning. The staff was nice, they didn't speak English like many of the reviews here said but hey, it's latin America, learn some Spanish.\",\n \"I stayed here 4 nights and really loved it. There is a big garden out back which really makes it special. The breakfasts are great and included in the price of the room (coffee sucks though, but there's a kitchen if you wnat to bring your own). The staff is super helpful and friendly. I was in a single room with a shared bath. Bathrooms were good and clean. Rooms are a bit boxy, but fine. great location. free wifi. Nice big kitchen outside by the garden. It's a great value.\",\n \"I liked staying here. It's in a chill and relatively quiet area of Antigua, but still close to cafes, restaurants, the market (big plus!), etc. It's clean, the rooms are decent, the bathrooms and showers are decent, it has a very big common space, amazing internet, good price, accessible kitchen, big outdoor patio. I highly recommend it for seasoned travelers who don't want a party vibe.\",\n 'Found this place by chance and it was perfect for us. After trip to coast, emailed and had quick response, got same room back for few more days. So quiet and clean with garden area in back and kitchen available if desired. Breakfast included and can choose from 5 different options. Great place to stay!',\n 'I stayed with my husband at Casa Encatada for one night. The service is very good, you will find enough privacy and a lovely roof where the breakfast is served also bar. If you are looking the advantages of bigger hotels, you can also get a pass to visit Porta Hotel antigua, to enjoy pool, jacuzzi and massage services. The best rooms are the ones that are at \"paso de agua\" because you don\\'t have the street and car crossing noise. Also up stairs, you will find more silence and better view.',\n 'We stayed as a group of 4 friends in a big room, the place was clean, central and quiet.  The terrace on the roof is really nice! view on the Volcano! the courtyard is also nice, great colors.  We had a good time in there, the staff is helpful.   The only con is that the wi fi is mainly available nearby the reception and not in the rooms.',\n 'Decided to escape the city for a day and ended up backpacking to Antigua.  I found this place after walking a bit looking for affordable places to crash.  I can say this place is great for the money.  Not full with amenities, but if you want to rest and enjoy the city, this is a great place to stay.',\n 'Posada San Vincente is a nice garden oasis. It is centrally located near some great local restaurants (check out the specials at the Rainbow Cafe). Our small double room was nice enough, but smelled mildly of cleaner or detergent (at least it was clean). The showers were dependably hot and the bathroom consistently cleaned. The beds were comfortable enough for a decent sleep and it was quiet at night. The television in the room was fine. Staff were very helpful in providing further travel information and as mentioned the room was always cleaned and maintained during our stay. There is a fantastic roof-top which is highly under-utilised but make sure you get yourself some drinks and spent a sunset up there. Really lovely.',\n 'We recommend this hotel. We stayed for New Year 2012 -2013. It was comfortable, near the central park; service was good, very helpful and willing to assist you. Also it is very safe. Fair for the price.  CONS: - TV could be better, the rooms have old CRT TV instead of flat screen, you don’t really watch TV when in Antigua, but still… - No phone in room - Late at night 11pm up; I found Internet connection intermittent, during the day from 7am up it is great.',\n \"... its ok, but not great, its the small things that let it down, eg weak intermittent wifi, luke warm showers, noisy, etc. but saying that they have thought about individual bunk sockets and reading lights even though I couldn't connect to wifi in my particular dorm. It's a perfect young 'flashpackers' place, with bar parties most evenings, organised tours, and a reasonably priced laundry service. The narrow roof terrace has intetesting views, the garden hammocks are relaxing, and the kitchen is adequate. The hostel is about one and a half kilometers from the bus park where there is a great open-air market too\",\n 'I love staying at Hotel Casa Santo Domingo because it is so beautiful. I highly recommend staying there if you are visiting Antigua. The only draw back is the attitude of the people who work there, especially the front desk people. They act like they are God’s gift to the world and you are trash. I used to stay at Hotel Casa Santo Domingo for every trip to Antigua (I go once to twice a month) but now I stay at other hotels with nicer staff. The beauty of the hotel is amazing but after you have been there a few times, I would rather stay at a place with friendlier staff. Beware if you are planning an event - they are difficult to deal with and all hotels in Antigua, not just Casa Santo Domingo, will cancel on you with little warning (a month’s notice). This happened to me and we',\n 'The hotel was beautifuland provided a quiet refuge frome the bustling streets whos population doubled every day for the festivities. It was a combination of luxury accommodations and tasteful religious artifacts amidst centuries old ruins of a Dominican monastery. We had a \"conventual suite\" that was spacious and comfortable.

Restaurant was ok in comparison to other comparable restaurants in town, but the service was impeccable, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The surroundings absolutely gorgeous.',\n 'Excellent position, less than 10 mins from the Parque Central and three mins from Santa Catalina Arch. From outside, on a quiet cobbled street, it looks fairly nondescript but once you enter it is fabulous, with lots of corridors, leafy patios and drawing rooms decorated in a beautiful mixture of traditional Mayan and Spanish colonial style. The corridors / galleries outside the first floor rooms were wide enough to hold plenty of comfortable seating, and there was even the bonus of a roof terrace overlooking the town. Our room was small (for which I have subtracted a star) and it was a squeeze to get round the bed, but it was nicely decorated, comfortable and the bathroom (also small) had a good shower.',\n 'The location is near a very large market, and on a busy road.  There is a lot of road noise at night.  My room was on the second floor.  The room itself had decent space.  The bathroom was very cramped, to the point of sitting down sideways to using the toilet.  That said, I saw good bones up on the higher floors and they were hauling in new mattresses while I stayed.  So much of the hotel seemed unfinished.  Outside my room was a large empty area that had potential for so much more.  I saw this also on the third floor and on the mini roof area.  If you do take the chance, ask for the third floor as the rooms up there are set back more from the road and would have a good view.  The staff did seem to be good, although I had very little communication with them.',\n 'I found myself in Antigua, quite unplanned. I stayed at Posada Don Valentino. This little hotel was very pleasant, clean, safe and there was plenty of hot water. Also, TWO towels for my shower.  Not a four star luxury hotel, but very nice and I would stay there again.',\n '- Las camas del segundo nivel no son muy cómodas y hacen mucho ruido al moverse (habitaciones 6 y 7) - Mejorar atención al cliente en recepción. - Esta en un calle principal y las habitaciones se escucha mucho ruido,aun en la madrugada por el paso de los vehículos. - La Habitación del tercer nivel cuádruple es de las mejores.',\n 'This is a very clean hotel, with very helpful girls at the desk (Aury and Sara).

But the privet room had no hot water as been told and was not clean. But the thing that really was not cool was that the owner screwed us by selling us a cab to the airport. We had to be there around 6 in the morning to go to Tikal and we could take a bus at 4 in the morning for 8 dollers. But the owner told us we would not have enough time. it should take us 1:30 ours by car. So we took a cab for 40 dollar since we did not wanted to miss the plane. The cab was driving 40 km a hour and it took us 45min to get to the airport.  Antigua is really nice! ont mis it',\n \"I wanted to write this review for any of you who might be thinking of staying at this hostel. First off, the hostel is really nice. The design of the walls and colors used are great and relaxing. Not a bad location, however the lady who owns the place, Blanca, doesn't wash the sheets after each person uses them. A couple of friends of mine and I were staying there and actually witnessed her and another girl, Nancy, cleaning the rooms. Blanca actually told Nancy not to change the sheets on one of the top bunks because the guy who had slept there had only stayed one night. Me and my other friends looked at each other in disgust.

I had a clean room, huge bed, but not much hot water. Breakfast on the rooftop terrace made up for the lack of hot water! It was magical! I have stayed in other hotels in Antigua and have had other views, but this was a new one and the sky in the evening was glorious. There seemed to be only one young man at the desk the first day who spoke English. I needed a shuttle to get me to Atitlán and they couldn't help with that, but there were two travel agencies right around the corner so that wasn't a problem either. Great location and the restaurant Saberico right there!\",\n 'To say this is a moderate hotel is way over-stated.  We reserved a two bed room.  Our first reaction was being hit by the smell of mold and mildew coming from the bathroom.  There was no table, chair or anything to lay our luggage on.  The beds were against walls that were crumbling with about a 2 foot gap between the two single beds.  There was visible black mold growing in the bathroom, by the sink, shower and even on the ceiling.  The only air source was from a transom window directly onto a very noisy hallway.  Our first course of action was to ask for a different room.  We were shown two:  The Kingsize bedroom right next door (same exact issues), then another further in the back of the hotel that was even smaller and had a cracked toilet with brown stains inside the bowl.

Right plonk in centre of the majority of places i preferred to visit.The rooms are new I think and very nicely decorated. Only negative is they charge a hefty fee for using credit card and all the rooms were ‘damp’ in feel/smell during the time I was there (hopefully that was momentary). Breakfast is pretty good. Wifi works well in rooms.',\n 'We stayed here twice while in Guatemala. The staff was very accommodating, the rooms were clean and breakfast was fine. Our room was rather warm but we had a fan.  The beds were comfortable even though we fought with the sheets slipping off the mattress.  There is a pretty courtyard and also a rooftop view. WiFi was in the courtyard.',\n 'This place does the job. It is in a great location in Antigua, right in the centre opposite the handicraft market and everything is within walking distance and on first sight this place looks beautiful and peaceful. However, as nice and clean as the rooms are, there is no privacy in this place as the walls are paper thin. You can hear everything from every room, you can hear noise from the lobby up on the third floor, and the staff do not seem to care about this. The lady on reception during the day was less than helpful, and when a member of our group asked her to turn down the loud coldplay music because one of us was trying to sleep we were rudely told no because she wanted to listen to it while having lunch with her friends in the middle of the courtyard.

Would definitely stay here again and recommend.',\n \"Pros: pleasant and personable innkeeper, convenient location to central plaza and local attractions, quirky decor with lots of oddball antiques, great views from rooftop deck.  Cons: rooms can be noisy with music and socializing in common areas, furniture in common areas is not very comfortable, sheets old and worn--but clean, pillows are all flat, beds with old mattresses; don't stay here if you are allergic to mold or mildew.

The staff were extremely friendly & helpful.  The breakfast is a real positive, included in the price & you have a choice of five different menus.  I took the last remaining bed in the Casa & that happened to be a dorm bed. I don't usually opt for dorm stays as I prefer a bit of privacy.  That said, the beds were very comfortable, although the one draw back is that the dorm is too small for the three bunks in the room, as the remaining floor space does not allow for room to unpack, repack or organise your bag.  Overall, I would recommend staying here.\",\n 'Close to the market, and 10 minutes form central park.  Staff is really friendly, speak pretty good english.

The showers are NOT hot... it is luke warm at best, I hated showering because I was so cold every time. The other thing is that you hope you don't get a room by the bar because you will not be able to sleep before 11pm or so. It depends what you're looking for in a hostel but something about the vibe here was missing for me. I personally wouldn't stay again but if these things don't bother you then you would probably enjoy it!

To their credit, they do have an 11pm curfew which seems to be fairly well enforced, but you still get loud people talking as they walk past at all hours of the night which is a shame.

Así mismo, la falta de normas dentro del hotel hace que muchas veces se dificulte dormir, ya que muchos de los huespedes llegan borrachos haciendo escándalo y los encargados no les dicen nada.

But once we‘ve checked in we were very disappointed: - The kitchen was very dirty, there were bugs everywhere (e.g. in the fridge) - The bathroom was dirty as well, there were backlogs of hair in the shower and the whole area looked pretty uncleaned - The rooftop area was dirty and shabby, dirt everywhere and it looked run-down.

Last but not least they serve you water in plastic bottles, taking into account their country has serious garbage recycling issues',\n \"I stayed at Luna Maya for 3 nights over Christmas. Definitely more expensive than most hostels in Antigua but nice.  Not the place if you want a social scene.  Dorm beds were really comfortable and if you have a bottom bunk it’s like have a pod with a curtain, light and even a shelf. Top bunks have steps not scary ladders. Easy to get a good night's sleep.  Nice bathroom and no one else ever seemed around, so not busy even though just one per dorm room. Limited social space or maybe just no one knows to use it or doesn't feel like they can use it. I pretty much never saw other guests, everyone in my room seemed to be in bed by 8 and off by 6.  Front desk staffed 8 to 8, so it seems desolate at night, like wandered around an abandoned mansion. They understand English but don’t\",\n 'I stayed at Luna Maya for several nights and loved the place. It was very peaceful and clean and a great little oasis to relax in after a long day.   The beds were super comfortable and there was plenty of space in the dorms. The pictures on their website are quite accurate in this respect.   There was a yoga studio in the building but I didn’t see any schedule for taking part which might have been good to get guests involved. They did let me use the room for my own practice which was nice. I also noticed there was a room set up for massage but again no details on prices or booking. A few people passing through were looking for massages so they really missed a trick here.   My only complaint with this place was their enthusiasm for cleaning the dorms in the mornings. On the day',\n 'Hi  We stayed there to experience the lovely ruins of Antigua which were declared by the UN as a world heritage city.  To our surprise the hotel was not inside Antigua historic district, but it was inside a complex of newly built homes outside Antigua.  Anyone who goes to to this beautiful city surely wants to experience the history and the culture.  This hotel has nothing to do with the lovely ambiance of the city.',\n \"Great boutique hotel right outside of Antigua.  The rooms were superbly done using an eye for detail and sense of style.  I can't remember the name of our suite, but it had a french door that opened right onto the small lap pool and a working fireplace, really quiet charming.   The staff was unobtrusive and always there when you needed them, if not, they gave you privacy and made you feel like you had run of this gorgeous villa.   Breakfast on the rooftop in the morning is unforgettable.  This hotel isn't in Antiqua proper, rather a very short walk from the main square....it's built in a new secure planned complex, where in time (we're told) there will be restaurants and other amenities, but as for now, it's kind of quiet and feels a little empty.   Regardless, this charming\",\n 'Lovely little hostel where breakfast is included in the price of the dorms. More affordable for you penny pinchers, dorms in high season were 9 usd per night, but were relatively cramped with little space to place your bags if the dorms are full. The breakfast is good and there is a lovely courtyard to sit outside and enjoy some sunshine in the quiet.   Pros: -free breakfast -cheap -clean bathrooms and dorms -taco shop located inside the hostel for 3 tacos for 10Q  Cons: -overcharge for laundry services  -on the outskirts of the city, about a 15 minute walk to central plaza  -no outside liquor allowed in the hostel and they only serve beer ',\n 'I stayed here 3 different times for a total of 16 nights.  I tried other, more ‘popular’ hostels, but kept returning to Casa Jacaranda!  Helpful staff.  Reliable wifi.  Inexpensive Mexican food and beers in the lobby.  I liked that it was quiet and somewhat under-the-radar.  Showers could be hotter.',\n 'We booked this hostel through hostel world in September of 2013 since we knew that Antigua would be a popular spot for New Years Eve. We paid a 10% deposit and were told our booking was confirmed. We showed up with the print-out of our confirmation (as we were told to do) and the guy at the front desk was incredibly unhelpful and pretty rude. He told us they had NO record of our booking (which basically means they lost it) and then told us 1) the problem was with hostel world and that we would need to contact them; and 2) that this had happened to someone else earlier that day! This was pretty infuriating since I have used hostel world before and not ended up in this situation, so I know that Jacaranda must have lost our reservation (though I am in the process of complaining',\n \"The rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The hostel was conveniently located about 10 minutes from the main square, and breakfast was included in the very reasonable price of the room. We stayed in a full dorm and space was limited, however I never felt cramped and there was a secure area designated for any extra luggage. There was free Wi-Fi, however it was only available in the main entrance and living room. Despite this small inconvenience, the internet speed was great and there was no shortage of plugs for laptops. There was also a computer available to guests who did not bring their own.  There was only one shower for all of the dorm rooms, however I didn't experience any problems even when the hostel was at almost full-capacity. There were several\",\n 'This is the second time we have stayed here. It is a great location, 1 1/2 blocks off the main square. The hotel is very clean, the included breakfast is excellent, and the staff is very friendly. Downside, the rooms are very small. Some of the rooms barely have room for you, much less spreading out your bags. Insist on one of the larger rooms with two beds if you can. The picture is of the courtyard for breakfast.

Accueil très sympa. On nous a tout de suite amené à notre chambre. L'hôtel avait deja prélevé l'argent sur mon compte. La chambre était propre mais très humide. Les draps sentaient l'humidité mais à part ca le lit était très moelleux et moi j'adore! Le wifi fonctionne par intermittence mais ca nous coupe du monde extérieur c'est pas plus mal! Le petit déjeuner est plutôt bien, j'ai adoré les pancakes et la confiture de fraise!\",\n 'This is a nice hotel, a bit hard to find, near the center of Antigua. The hotel promotes itself as 4 star hotel, we think that is a bit optimistic, 2 or 3 stars would be more honest. Still it is a nice place to stay, modest breakfast included. Friendly service. Wifi was not great. Rooms nice and cosy. Affordable rates.',\n 'Antigua is unique place to visit, and Real Antigua Hotel offers accommodation directly in this old city. Hotel has old spanish athmosphere, rooms are comfortable with shower and all necessary equipment. Hotel provides delicios breakfest in family-style. It is close to the centre with many restaurants and shops. Small market is just across the street.',\n 'Because its an older boutique hotel the room was small but the bed was comfortable. We had a language barrier but staff was extremely helpful and they used a translation app on their cell phones to help me.  We got everywhere we needed to be one time.  Breakfast included lots of excellent fruit and juice along with the usual coffee, eggs.  Market across the street opens early and closes late.  Lots of restaurants close by, and easy walking distance to explore the city.',\n \"The room is a bit small with shower faucets' hot & cold other way around. Staff is very helpful. Great location - supermarket right across the street. I like the fact it includes breakfast, which is prepared individually. A caraffe of good strong coffee included.\",\n 'The bed was comfortable, the room clean, the staff very nice and the location fantastic but the wifi was super slow, the taps in the shower in my room were installed wrong, it took 15 minutes of figuring out how to tweak it to get hot water, which was frustrating after a long day. Breakfast was supposed to be served between 7am-10am. I had a shuttle coming at 8 am, and was still waiting for food, which when finally did arrive, was a very small portion and had stale bread. Disappointing value for money in my opinion.',\n \"My wife and I enjoyed our stay during Semana Santa.  The rooms cost a little more than we expected, but this was probably due to the holidays.  Staff very helpful and friendly.  Older but very clean.  This hotel has a very nice area downstairs with tables in a shaded, plant filled, courtyard.  It also has a small kitchen for guests to use which contains a pila, refrigerator, stove, microwave, toaster oven and kitchen utensils/plates/silverware, etc.  This is useful if you don't want to eat out all the time.  Beds tend to be firm, which is what we like.  Rooms have two or three beds.  A basic budget hotel which grows on you.  We would definitely stay there again.  We are experienced travelers and have lived over six years in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Puerto Rico, and traveled in\",\n 'We stayed in many hotels during our 2 month trip, and this place was one of the bottom 3. Lot of noise during the night from the bar next door, so be aware, especially in the weekend. The staff did their best and were friendly, but limited info was available. Rooms were ok, a bit outdated, but I guess it was fair for the rate we were paying. I would not recomment this place, unless better options are fully booked.',\n 'Basic but clean hotel. Staff very helpful. Very close to the square. Avoid Saturday nights. There is a locals night club 200 ft away that plays music until 1-2 am. Bring earplugs on sat night stays. Not sure about Fridays. All other days are no problem...great place to stay.',\n 'The two guys who run this hostel are rude, arrogant and treat guests very unfairly. I am very patient and forgiving when it comes to hostels and hotels, however my patience only goes so far. I can only recommend people to look elsewhere.',\n \"This place oozes authenticity, its set around a beautiful courtyard garden and the rooms feature antiques which gives a lovely homely feel. The staff were super friendly and helpful, the rooms spacious and comfortable and it's just a short walk to everything but away from all the noise of the center. There are various hotels that match this in terms of comfort but this was definitely better value. The best part, this is called the house of dreams for good reason, the owner being someone who came here to create his dream - inspiring stuff!\",\n \"I rate this hotel low because of the poor services and rooms. When we arrived we asked the desk for two keys but were told we could only have one because they had a 24-hour receptionist to let us in the hotel and our rooms if necessary. The first night our kids were out late and when my wife and I arrived we could not get into the hotel and spent two hours waiting on the street till our kids came back and let us in. The sink and toilet were clogged and there was no one available to fix it.  The rooms have no privacy at all as all the windows face the courtyard and because of the hot weather it was very stuffy in our rooms with the windows closed.  The grounds were nice but all in all I don't recommend the hotel and would suggest another hotel in Antigua.  \",\n \"Beautiful place, great location a few blocks from Parque Central, Santo Domingo, and Las Capuchinas. Nice sized room, huge king sized bed, adequate bathroom with no water temperature or pressure issues. The grounds are gorgeous and well kept. Daily breakfast is fine if you mix it up a bit between the Desayuno Americano and the Chapina. There are three great bars on the street (Cafe No Se, La Biblioteca, and Cafe Sky) and some excellent eateries (Angie Angie, Y Tu Pina Tambien) and if you are a night owl you can party close to home. The staff's English language skills are limited but sufficient, and Monica the receptionist was outstanding in assisting us with navigating things like reserving a tour at Casa Popenoe across the street or getting us to a florist to bring a lunch gift\",\n 'I asked if they just opened and I was told no. This place is spotless. The rooms have a nice bed 2 night stands reading lamps. It has the works.  They had a special for 20US a night as well.  They also have a kitchen..also looked new that was on the roof with a view.  Also they let us keep our dogs at the hostel.....We clean up after them.  Staff was great as well.  Not a party hostel.  They need one thing drapes on the windows for the light, you can not see in the glass.  They have other hostels in town as well. I have stayed at one and it was just as nice.  Free Wifi as well.',\n \"It is a BEAUTIFUL hotel! I loved it. I came to antigua to explore my Guatemalan roots and staying in this city and hotel has definitely made me love my culture and the beauty of my dad's country. Def stay here but beware the food service is :/ ehh!\",\n 'We stayed here on our first night in Antigua, very nice friendly staff and accommodating as they checked us in early and kept our bags for few hours after check out. They also rang around for coffee tour for us and recommended tuctuc for cheaper transport.  Only downside is the funny cleaner they use on bathroom... Smells out the whole place for a while! ',\n \"My family makes the Hotel Casa del Parque  our home base in Guatemala. Super-close to the main plaza, it is classic old Antigua, vintage pavers on the ground, colorful hand-crafted tile throughout the public spaces. It is homey, not luxurious. Bathrooms are small but adequate. Breakfast is served in the dining area adjoining the pool area; it usually costs $5 US and has hot items (eggs, beans, potatoes, etc) as well as lots of fresh fruit. From the dining area you can see part of the cathedral's roof, and one of the volcanoes. Staff have always been very friendly and helpful.\",\n \"We had exactly the same experience that Lisette just described: No pool -it was been repaired- even though it was advertised, no sleeping not because of the construction but because of the pool´s motor when it was been filled and also due to the bar next door over the weekend... and bad service, specially at night.  We got no compensation even though we decided to stay in spite of the pool been repaired.  They did not seem to care, nor did they give much important to our words when we told them that we would give them a bad review due to all of the above and to the fact that they charged us 28% more than the initial amount advertised on booking.  We don't know if this was booking´s fault or their own, but we felt disappointed, neglected and uncomfortable.

On Tripadvisor.com, Posada San Pedro I is called “Hotel Posada San Pedro” & Posada San Pedro II is called “Hotel San Pedro”. The photos that accompany Hotel Posada San Pedro are a mixture of these two hotels. The pink walled rooms are from San Pedro I while the yellow walled rooms are from San Pedro II.  The hotel website provides information about both hotels.    We arranged airport pick up through San Pedro II and stayed there 3 nights in Dec. 2019.

Au calme, à proximité du centre, terrasse bien agréable. Chambres propres, avec chacune un cachet différent. Bon rapport qualité prix.',\n 'We stayed two nights in an upstairs double room that was fine.  Rooms are situated around a lovely courtyard.  There is a rooftop patio with nice views of the surrounding volcanoes.  Good shower.  Did not include breakfast but there are good places to eat close by.  Can arrange shuttles to and from the airport. Wifi is spotty. They let you know in advance that they do not accept credit cards.  No problem with that.  However, when you pay in soles, they calculate the bill using 8 quetzales per dollar instead of the going rate of 7.5.  Not a big difference, but slightly irritating,',\n 'Excelente ubicación y muy bien antendida. Es una muy buena opción para alojar en Antigua, muy limpio, tranquilo, un buen desayuno a la hora que lo pidas y a un buen precio. Tiene buen internet y el ambiente es muy hogareño, te pasan una llave del hotel y puedes moverte en él como si estuvieras en tu casa.',\n 'The owner has collected various antiques, and other collectables for 21 years I think it is, and this guest house is filled with all sorts of items - very different and interesting. The service was excellent and location great. Our room was functional.',\n 'Great location, cute hotel with fun decor and every room a different shape and size. Large rooms, free wifi, really nice and helpful owner, and excellent location. My room was huge but the shower water came out as a small stream rather than shower. And because the location is good, there is a fair amount of street noise for some of the rooms.',\n 'You know you are in Guatemala!  Authentic, charming, and full of character.   Guatemalan antiques and artisan furniture fill the common areas (every inch) and the rooms.  Not a large courtyard to roam about like some of the Antigua hotels have .. small & charming.  We had room almost in the lobby ... ask for upstairs room.  Our room was perhaps configured as a second thought .. not real walls ... the wall that separated us from the lobby was made of window panels w/ curtains or shutters for privacy .. which then meant little light. It also was next to the kitchen so a bit noisy.   It was a beautiful room, though. The staff was super nice and helpful .. courteous.  You will love your stay here and feel as if you have escaped the hotelesque places.  Perfect location.',\n 'We stayed for four nights and enjoyed the perfectly appointed room. Breakfast next door at the Porta Hotel was included and was something we looked forward to after our morning walks. We also appreciated the use of the sauna since we arrived on a cold, rainy day! The staff at Encatada was gracious and helpful, serving coffee at any time of day. We stayed in the smallest room (#5) and think this rating might have been 5 stars with a different room assignment.',\n \"A beautiful hotel in many ways but the rooms are tiny.

They give you a key to get into The hotel couse they use to close The door At 6 pm but you can arrive at any time you want.',\n 'This is a beautiful hotel with a very peaceful atmosphere.  The rooms were a little dark but well furnished with an excellent powerful shower.  The beds were small, we had a triple room but there were two very small doubles.  The breakfast was really very good as was dinner although the bar was over priced with little atmosphere.   We found information a little scarce so did not know about the other part of the hotel.  The chocolate and candle factories were no more than a small shop and the museums were a bit lacking but overall it is a nice place just a little impersonal.

I had been tipping the staff all along so when the bill came I had an issue with it. They eventually resolved it but suddenly the staff was not so nice. They need to be up front with this.

Most of the college students were between the ages of 25-35 (graduate students).  We had fun, and nearly took over the hostel since there were so many of us.  The service was great and the staff very friendly.  It was clean and always neat.  I felt safe and secure there and there were no security problems.  But the walls are \"paper-thin\" and you could hear someone flushing the toilet or taking a shower even if your room was down the hall.  Additionally, the \"hot water\" was nearly non-existent  as the electric fixtures preparing hot water really did not work.  Don\\'t touch them, you will get a shock!
